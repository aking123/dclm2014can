	"Words" => "Doctrine to the church is what a foundation is to a building. It is the article of faith on which a believer&rsquo;s faith is anchored. A building with a weak foundation will collapse under intense unfavourable weather and environmental conditions while a building with solid foundation will weather through storms (Matthew 7:24-27). A believer&rsquo;s steadfastness and stability in the Lord is dependent on a firm grasp of the Truth revealed in the Bible (Ephesians 4:13,14). Whereas, lack of knowledge leads to backsliding and destruction (Hosea 4:6). In a world of error and deceit engineered by Satan and his hosts (John 8:44), a believer needs to be well grounded in the truth in order to frontally attack every lie of Satan if he is to remain in faith (Matthew 4:3,4).
</p>
<p>
The early believers understood perfectly the need to be grounded in the doctrines. Both old and young engaged in spiritual activities that built up their Christian character and convictions. They studied the doctrines, prayed and celebrated the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (Acts 2:41-47). It should be observed that, the study of the doctrines took a place of pre-eminence in their ministry. These Spirit-directed activities of the early saints led to the phenomenal growth of the early Church. Apart from this, it brought about boldness, steadfastness, and growth (Daniel 11:32; Acts 4:19,20), to the extent that the whole of Jerusalem was filled with Christ&rsquo;s doctrine (Act 5:28).
</p>
<p>
Paul understood the centrality of Bible doctrines to Christian maturity, hence
he counselled the Ephesian Christians that spiritual gifts were endowed them in
order to teach doctrines that will bring about Christian perfection (Ephesians 4:11-14). His counselling to Timothy, his son in the Lord was: &ldquo;Take heed unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shall both save thyself and them that hear thee&rdquo; (I Timothy 4:16). Paul&rsquo;s counsel to Titus who was left in Crete to set things that are wanting in order was that he should hold &ldquo;fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers&rdquo; (Titus 1:9).
</p>
<p>
As believers, workers, preachers, missionaries, and leaders like Paul, Timothy
and Titus, our steadfastness to the end is dependent on the understanding of the
doctrines (I Timothy 4:16). Also, the salvation of our congregation depends on their understanding of the doctrines. A thorough understanding of the doctrines then is indispensable to all members of the church. The strength or weakness of the church depends to a large extent on the members attitude to the doctrines (I Peter 3:15; 2 Timothy 2:15; Colossians 3:16; John 5:39; Deuteronomy 4:4-9).
The doctrines which the church stands upon are not mere dogmas or the opinions
of men. They are inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:15,16).
</p>
<p>
The Bible clearly teaches on Repentance, Restitution, Marriage, New Heaven
and Hell among others. These Bible doctrines explicitly reveal treasures that a
Christian cannot do without. The reason and hope of our faith are embedded in these doctrines (I Peter 3:15).
</p>
<p>
Every believer today in the church, old or young needs to benefit from the
doctrines of Christ. This can only come about through indepth study, prayerful
meditation and internalisation of truths studied and a faithful practice of these teachings (2 Timothy 2:15).
</p>
<p>
Neglect of doctrines and the pursuit of superficiality has done incalculable
damage to the church in our generation. Emphasis on activities with the attendant neglect of personal Bible study has ruined many lives. Thus, superficial Christian living, backsliding, lukewarmness, worldliness and entertainment of false teaching are rampant in christendom (Hosea 4:6).
</p>
<p>
We are in perilous times (2 Timothy 3:1-5); and to be able to hold our heads above the water, we must earnestly contend for the faith. Believers are on the battlefield and we must do violence with Satan and his hosts before we can have entrance into heaven (Matthew 11:12). Our chief weapon of warfare is the truth which is embedded in the doctrines. Knowledge of the truth will set us free from the lies of Satan, and it will also guarantee our true freedom in Christ (John 8:32). In order to counteract Satan&rsquo;s strategies, we need to dig deep into the doctrines.
</p>
<p>
The mission of the church as light to the world (Matthew 5:16) is only achievable with a grasp of the foundational truth or God&rsquo;s word. A church that is ignorant cannot teach the world, as the blind cannot lead the blind. Clearly stated, the unchanging mission of the church is to evangelise and teach the world (Matthew 28:19,20). This responsibility falls on individual believers within the fold today. It is the aggregate that makes the whole; and without a well informed congregation, the church would be unable to fulfil this goal. Knowledge of the basic foundational truths greatly helped the early church to fulfil its mission. They were able to establish new converts, confront the errors of the Pharisees and Sadduccees, and endure the persecution of their opposers.
</p>
<p>
The time has come to accomplish Christ&rsquo;s mission to the world. But the battle
for truth can only be fought by the enlightened believer. As individual members of the church, we ought to arise today and fill the gap left by the saints of old.</p>"

$doctrines[] = array("Title" => "The Holy Bible",
	"Heading" => "That the Holy Bible, consisting of 39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New Testament, is the inspired Word of God. We take the Bible as final authority in all matters concerning Christian conduct and work",
	"Citation" => "2 Timothy 3:16,17; Proverbs 30:5,6; Revelation 22:18,19.",
	"Words" => "The Holy Bible is the inspired Word of God and is the only source of knowledge of the Almighty God to all mankind. It is the contact point between finite man with the infinite God; and its prime purpose is to give mankind the revelation of God (2 Timothy 3:15-17). The Bible is severally referred to as the Holy Scriptures (Romans 1:2; 2 Timothy 3:15), the oracles of God (Romans 3:2; Hebrews 5:12), the Book of the Lord (Isaiah 34:16), the word of God (Mark 7:13), the word of Christ (Colossians 3:16) and the word of life (Philippians 2:16). It is in two major parts: the Old and the New Testaments. It consists of 66 books: 39 of which are in the Old Testament, 27 in the New Testament. The Bible was originally written predominantly in Hebrew and Greek. The Old Testament was written in Hebrew and Aramaic, while the New Testament was written in Greek language. Over 40 authors drawn from disparate generations spanning a period of over 1600 years, were used by God to write the Bible.
Even though their occupations, education and social classes were divergent, their theme was the same as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:20). The
inspiration of the authors can be attested to by some peculiar characteristics of the Bible, which are not found in any other book written by man. Such characteristics include its wonderful unity despite the fact that the authors lived at different ages;
its versatility as it meets the needs of all people irrespective of race, and language (Matthew 4:4); its superiority to other books, the influence on individuals and nations; its preservation over the centuries, its fulfilled prophecies (Isaiah 7:14;
Ezekiel 36:19; 2 Chronicles 7:19,20) and its perfection (Psalms 19:7; James 1:25).
</p>
<p>
The pre-eminence of the Bible (Isaiah 8:20; Psalms 119:89) makes it indispensable to all men today. While other books have limited influence on man, because they are products of finite minds, the Bible which is God&rsquo;s revelation to man has solution to every problem today. Therefore, no man&rsquo;s education is complete if he is ignorant of the provisions of the Bible. No Christian can live successfully without an adequate grasp of the Bible, and no Christian minister is really qualified for the ministry of the church of Christ without a thorough knowledge of the Bible (2 Timothy 2:15). Without a ready knowledge of the Bible, the Christian worker cannot be effective.
</p>
<p>
The central theme of the Bible is CHRIST and HIS WORK OF REDEMPTION (John 20:31; Luke 24:25-27; Revelation 1:1). He is the Old Testament concealed, and the New Testament revealed. To fully understand the Bible and to rightly interpret its messages, we must first receive Jesus Christ as Saviour and have a clear and definite experience of conversion. Those who do not know Christ and those who have wrong conceptions about Christ cannot interpret the Bible appropriately because the carnal man cannot understand the things of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 2:14).
</p>
<p>
The Bible has a ministry to unbelievers as well as to believers. To unbelievers,
the Bible brings conviction of sin which leads to repentance and faith in Christ Jesus. To believers, the goals of the Bible are various. It is to make believers perfect (Psalm 119:9,11), to reveal the condition of their hearts (Hebrew 4:12; Jeremiah 17:9,10); it is a light to the believers&rsquo; feet or way of life (Psalms 119:105;130), food for the soul (Deuteronomy 8:3, John 21:17; Psalm 19:10; Matthew 4:4), a medicine to the body and soul (Proverbs 4:20-22; Psalm 107:20; Matthew 8:8) and the Sword of the Spirit (Ephesians 6:17; Matthew 4:1-11). It is a mirror to reflect (James 1:23); a hammer to convict, and fire to refine (Jeremiah 23:29); seed to multiply (I Peter 1:23); water to cleanse (Ephesians 5:26; John 15:3); rain to refresh (Isaiah 55:10); gold to enrich (Psalm 19:7-10); and power to create life and faith (I Peter 1:23; Romans 10:17).
</p>
<p>
The Bible is God&rsquo;s inspired revelation of the origin and destiny of all things. It is the power of God unto eternal salvation and it is the source of present help for the body, soul and spirit (Romans 1:16; John 15:7). It is God&rsquo;s will and testament to man in all ages, revealing the plan of God for man here and now, and in the next life. It is the record of God&rsquo;s dealing with men; past, present and future. It contains God&rsquo;s message of eternal salvation to all who believe in Christ and of eternal damnation to those who rebel against the gospel (John 3:18,36).
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the Bible then is to reveal God to man, reveal man&rsquo;s need of God and show man the way to God. Man, by searching, cannot find God except God makes Himself known to him (Job 11:7). The Bible also reveals to man how to live, and through the fulfillment of its prophecies, all human needs are met. We receive salvation, sanctification, Holy Ghost baptism, healing, deliverance, protection, etc.
</p>
<p>
To profit maximally from the study of the Bible, we must remove all hindrances
to spiritual receptivity, such as hardened heart (Matthew 13:3-6, 18-21), double
mindedness (James 1:8; Mark 4:15-17), pride (Deuteronomy 8:11-14; Psalm 101:5;
Proverbs 18:12), carnality (I Corinthians 3:1-5), and unbelief (Matthew 13:58).
</p>
<p>
Every believer in the church today can benefit from the hidden treasures in the
Bible. But this would require sacrifices on our part. Treasures are not found except by searching or digging earnestly. Likewise, deep Bible truths need be sought for, and in doing this, we will discover Christ the more (Colossians 2:3; John 5:39). Certain spiritual preparations are required from believers in order to discover these treasures that would make them develop into the fullness of the stature of Christ.
There must be earnest love for the truth for its own sake (Psalm 119:40,47,54,72,103);
supreme love for God (Matthew 22:37; Deuteronomy 30:6; Psalm 73:25); and an
intense desire to know more of Him (Psalm 42:1,2; 63:1). Also, there should be a
strong desire to make Him known to others (Proverbs 11:24-26; Romans 9:1-3),
willingness to make personal sacrifice to study (Matthew 13:44-46; 12:42), a fixed purpose to know, and a willingness to practice the whole truth you have learnt (Psalm 119:60,101,106; James 1:22-25; Ezra 7:10; Psalms 119:63; 57:7: 108:1), and cultivating a state of mind that will not be diverted to make provision for the flesh (Romans 13:14; Matthew 26:41).
</p>
<p>
Above all, you need too, a regular habit of prayer, resignation to the whole will of God and His word that will make you discover the treasures hidden in the Bible.");

$doctrines[] = array("Title" => "The Godhead",
       	"Heading" => "That the Godhead consists of three separate, distinct, and
	recognisable personalities and qualities, perfectly united in one. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are different Persons in the Godhead, not merely three names for one Person",
       	"Citation" => "Matthew 3:16,17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Matthew 28:19,20.",
	"Words" => "The Godhead consists of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. The Bible
clearly teaches that each member of the Godhead is God; separate, distinct and
recognisable personalities and qualities perfectly united in one. The Father is
called God (I Corinthians 8:6; Psalm 89:26; I Chronicles 29:10; Matthew 6:9), the
Son, Jesus Christ, is called God (Isaiah 9:6,7; John 20:28), and the Holy Ghost
is called God (Acts 5:3,4; I Corinthians 3:16,17; 6:19,20; Hebrews 3:7-9;
10:15,16). From the foregoing scripture references, it is clear that the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three distinct Persons, co-eternal, co-existent
and co-equal in power and divine attributes. The word &rdquo;GOD&ldquo; in Genesis 1:1
means Elohim and in Hebrew language this is the plural of El (The Strong One).
&rdquo;Elohim&ldquo; (The Strong Ones) appear more than 2,700 times in the Old Testament
and this plurality is seen in: &rdquo;Let US make man in OUR image, after OUR
likeness &ldquo; &rdquo;The LORD said ... let US go down, and there confound their language &ldquo;
(Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:6,7). The Godhead (Romans 1:20) is also referred to as
the Holy Trinity.
</p>
<p>
The unity of the Godhead is scripturally evidenced in the execution of all
divine plans and purposes. At creation, a significant fact about the Godhead
emerged with the use of the plural noun ldquo;us&rdquo;, by God Himself (Genesis 1:26).
Elementarily, this implies the involvement of more than one personality in the
creation of man. The same word continued to recur first, after the fall of man
(Genesis 3:22), and on the threshold of God&rsquo;s perfect desire to curb the foolish
excesses of man, by wisely confounding him with diverse languages (Genesis
11:7).
</p>
<p>
The testimony of scriptures on the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ reveals
the perfect unity of the Godhead. It was God&rsquo;s anointing and the power of the
Holy Ghost that enabled Jesus to fulfil His ministry (Acts 10:38).
</p>
<p>
The divine-human relationship also confirms God in three persons perfecting
the relationship of man with the Triune God (Ephesians 2:18). The complementary
functions of the Trinity are referred to in almost all books of the New Testament
(Matthew 3:16,17; 28:19; Mark 1:10; John 16:7-15; 6:37,44; Romans 8:16;
I Thessalonians 5:23; Ephesians 5:25; I Peter 1:2; Acts 10:38).
</p>
<p>
The three personalities in the Godhead acted together in the incarnation of
the Lord Jesus Christ. God the Father did not just make His Son available to
assume the garb of human flesh preparatory for His vicarious mission (John
3:16). This was a supernatural work made possible by the power of the Holy Ghost
(Luke 1:35).
</p>
<p>
Further proof of the truth about the Godhead became clear at the baptism
of Jesus Christ, when the Father sent the Holy Ghost in bodily form as a dove
upon Christ, and God Almighty Himself made a public proclamation of Jesus as
His beloved Son (Matthew 3:16,17). Even at the outset of His ministry, Jesus
affirmed the companionship of God the Father and the Holy Ghost with Him. It
was only by their combined workings that He was to fulfil His multi-pronged
ministry of preaching the gospel, healing the sick, delivering the captives, etc. (Luke 4:18).
</p>
<p>
Truly, the work of redemption which Jesus Christ completed by submitting
Himself to die on the cross, was a joint venture with the Father and the Holy Ghost
(Hebrews 9:14), as was the second work of grace, sanctification or holiness, by
which man is cleansed from his in-bred depravity, the fallen nature he inherited
from Adam (Romans 15:16). Also, the Godhead is at work in empowering
believers through the baptism in the Holy Spirit, to discharge the duties handed
them by God (John 15:26; 16:7-15; Luke 11:13).
</p>
<p>
Christ&rsquo;s command as He handed down the Great Commission to His disciples
was to baptise all that repent and believe the gospel, in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19).
</p>
<p>
Even today, our prayer involves the three personalities in the Godhead. We
direct our prayers to God the Father (Luke 11:2; 22:42; 23:34,46; John
17:1,5,24-26; James 1:5) through Jesus Christ, the Son (John 14:13,14; 15:16);
and of course, without the help of the Holy Spirit all our prayers will be in vain
(Romans 8:26).
</p>
<p>
The Godhead is the universal testimony of the scriptures, for &ldquo;there are three
that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word (Son) and the Holy Ghost: and
these three are one&rdquo; (I John 5:7). It is only the perfect work of the Godhead that
has continued to sustain us on a day-to-day basis as believers (2 Corinthians
13:14).
</p>
<p>
The Godhead is a great mystery which is clearly beyond the finite mind of the
unsaved natural man (I Corinthians 2:14). The believer accepts the gospel truth
of the Trinity by faith, recognising that God remains the eternal repository of all
mysteries (Deuteronomy 29:29); that with respect to His being or essence, God
is one; with respect to His personality, God is three; and the essence must neither
be divided nor the persons confused. In spite of the great mystery surrounding
it, the doctrine of the Godhead has always proved to be eminently rich in spiritual
and practical values. And for all those willing, the Lord Jesus Christ promises
the advent of a blissful reign by the Godhead (John 14:23)."

$doctrines[] = array("Title" => "The Virgin Birth of Jesus",
	"Heading" => "The virgin birth of Jesus, the only begotten Son of God as well as His crucifixion, death, burial and bodily resurrection",
       	"Citation" => "Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-25; Romans 1:4; I Corinthians 15:3,4.",
	"Words" => "One of the most important facts concerning Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son
of God, is that He was born of a virgin. The virgin birth confirms Christ&rsquo;s Deity and
clearly distinguishes Him as the only sinless man conceived without Adamic
depravity.
</p>
<p>
The virgin birth is thus an essential doctrinal truth which must be upheld for
its fact and significance. Disputing this cardinal doctrine is by implication, denying
Christ&rsquo;s Deity and His distinctive nature. It was this distinctive spotlessness that
disqualified every other man from satisfying God&rsquo;s demand for substitutionary
death. He therefore became the spotless Lamb of God found in fashion as a man.
Men say - can there be such things as miracles? Is there not an antecedent
improbability that the order of nature, as we know it, should ever be changed? To
receive and believe the record of Christ&rsquo;s birth by a virgin-mother is to settle the
whole question of the miraculous.
</p>
<p>
God was the first to unveil the virgin birth of Christ, when He referred to Him
as the &ldquo;seed of the woman&rdquo; (Genesis 3:15). This was God&rsquo;s allusion to the fact that
Christ would be conceived by a woman who had never known a man. The prophet
Isaiah proclaimed, &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son...&rdquo; (Isaiah
7:14). The word &lsquo;virgin&rsquo; as used in this reference has obvious meaning and can be
nothing else but a woman that has not known a man. Luke, in his gospel narrative,
recorded that the angel Gabriel was sent to Mary, a virgin betrothed to a man
(Luke 1:26,27). Matthew, in his gospel, narrated that after Mary had been es-
poused to Joseph, she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost before they came
together (Matthew 1:18). He further recorded that Joseph knew her not till she
had brought forth her first born son, and he called his name JESUS.
</p>
<p>
Jesus, during His earthly ministry, sometimes referred to people as His mother,
His brothers and sisters, but never referred to any mortal man as His father - not even Joseph (Matthew 12:49,50; Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21). He always referred to God as His Father and this is another proof of His virgin birth. The Bible says that Joseph was a just man (Matthew 1:19). If Joseph had known Mary before
Christ was conceived or was responsible for the conception, he would not have
been thinking of putting her away, nor would he have qualified to be referred to as
a just man. On the other hand, if Mary as an espoused virgin had conceived
through a strange man, it would have been right for Joseph to have her out of the
way (Deuteronomy 22:13-21; Matthew19:9). The angel also would not have prevented Joseph from putting her away. The angel even bore witness that what was
in her was conceived of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 1:20). &ldquo;And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God&rdquo; (Luke 1:35). That was the announcement of the coming of the one only true virgin&rsquo;s child.
</p>
<p>
God bears witness to His approved ministers in various ways. Some of the
signs that were recorded concerning Christ were also recorded concerning a few
other messengers of God. A voice from the cloud witnessed to the ministry of
Christ, but that was not as unique as the virgin birth because we see a similar
witness in the ministry of Moses (Numbers 12:5-8; Matthew 17:5). And angel
announced the conception of Christ, but we also know that the birth of Samson
and John the Baptist were announced by angels (Judges 13:2-5; Luke 1:11-15,26-
33). However, Moses, Samson and John the Baptist had earthly fathers. They
were all descendants of Adam&rsquo;s fallen race. The virgin birth is therefore a unique sign from the Lord, conferred on Christ and Him alone. No other living soul had ever or will ever be conceived by a virgin. The virgin birth is not the only historical event that comfirms the deity of Christ. His crucifixion, death, burial and ressurrection from the dead do even more. The Old Testament is replete with prophecies concerning Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. And these propecies found fulfilment in the event on the cross (Genesis 3: 14,15; Psalm 22:6-8,16,18; Isaiah 53:3-6).
Christ also foretold His crucifixion and death while He was yet with His disciples before it came to pass. Christ was despised and rejected of men. As He hung on the cross; passers-by railed, and wagged their tongues at Him. Even His supposed friends forsook and abandoned Him at the darkest hour of His life. A crown of
thorns was plaited and placed on His head; stripes from barbed whips were laid on His back. He was wounded all over. His crucifiers drove long spikes through his hands and feet and pierced His side because of our transgressions. Apostle Peter brought the verity of His crucifixion on the religious sadists that perpetrated the act in His defence of the healing of the impotent man (Acts 4:5-10). Apostle Paul also preached it (1Corinthians 15:1-4). His crucifixion opens the floodgate of temporal and eternal blessings for man.
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ, the Pascal Lamb of God hanged on the cross of Calvary until
His life expired. His death became a reference point of events, time and date for the past, present and future. The soldiers on guard certified Him dead to Pilate before His body was released to Simon of Arimathea for burial. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses witnessed His burial in a sepulchre (Mark 15:43-47). The event on the cross is important to every man (Hebrews 2:9). Broadly stated, there are seven things Christ purchased for us through His death at the cross: forgiveness and full salvation (Luke 23:33,34), sanctification and holiness (Hebrews 13:12), a home in heaven (Luke 23:43), healing for all (Isaiah 53:5), deliverance from, and defeat of principalities and powers (Colossians 2:14,15), cancellation of every curse (Galatians 3:13), full and perfect redemption (Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14).
</p>
<p>
The bodily resurrection of Christ is mentioned 104 times in the New
Testament. But did Jesus rise from the grave? First, the soldiers who were
detailed to watch the tomb following the fear that the disciples might &ldquo;come by
night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead&rdquo;
(Matthew 27:64), knew that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was a physical reality. Second,
the Jews knew that the resurrection was not a concocted story. It cost them a
great deal of money, in their attempt to stop soldiers from spreading the news
(Matthew 28:11-15).Third, for years, the apostles proclaimed the resurrection in
Jerusalem, the very city where Jesus was crucified and where three days after,
He rose from the dead. The story of the resurrection has since the historic event
spread unchallenged. Speaking to the Jews on the day of Pentecost, Peter said,
&ldquo;This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses&rdquo; (Acts 2:32) and
nobody rose up to challenge him. Fourth, in Mark&rsquo;s gospel, Jesus appeared to Mary
Magdalene, who went and told Peter and other disciples &ldquo;as they mourned and
wept. And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of
her, believed not&rdquo; (Mark 16:10,11). Again, Jesus appeared to two of the disciples
(on their way to Emmanus). Yet, when &ldquo;they went and told it unto the residue:
neither believed they them&rdquo; (Mark 16:13). In fact, their fear and unbelief was
such that Jesus, on one occasion, upbraided them (Luke 24:25-27). By far, the
greatest proof of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is His bodily appearance to His disciples at
different times. It puts to rest the erroneous doctrine of spiritual resurrection.
</p>
<p>
Jesus is incomparably greater than any other prophet either before or after
Him. Why? Because He (Jesus) was &ldquo;declared to be the Son of God with power,
according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead&rdquo; (Romans
1:4). If teaching was the only thing that made Jesus the Son of God, He would not
be different. Founders of other religions taught good human principles as well. If
ascetic life, miracles, wonders and signs were the only things that made Thomas
to call Jesus, &ldquo;My Lord and my God,&rdquo; founders of other religions would also be
qaulified to be called &ldquo;God&rdquo; because they too lived ascetic lives and worked signs
and wonders. But, no, it is the resurrection that made all the difference. Because
of the resurrection, Jesus has been declared to be, not only the Son of God but
also, the Saviour and Judge of the whole world, of the living and the dead, the
Jews and the Gentiles, the Barbarians and the Greeks, the Hindus and the
traditional worshippers. Whoever therefore shall call upon Him today shall be
saved.");

Every man became totally inclined to evil (Psalm 51:1-5; Romans 3:10-18,23; 7:14-21; 5:12-17; Job 14:4; Isaiah 48:8). As a result of the fall of man (Adam and Eve), all men born through man and woman became sinners through inheritance. By inheriting the nature of sin, man became depraved. There is nothing in the natural man that has not been affected by the power of sin.
</p>
<p>
The entire nature of man, mentally, physically, morally and spiritually, has
been affected by sin. The testimony of the scriptures is that the image of God in
man has been seriously marred by this great fall. As a result of the fall, and the
nature of sin inherited, man became separated from God, totally alienated from
the perfect, holy and pure God. This separation is the cause of man&rsquo;s sorrow,
shame, fear, heartaches and manifold problems, spiritually and mentally. Man
became a transgressor (Romans 1:32; 6:23). All these have brought man under
the wrath and condemnation of God, &ldquo;for the soul that sinneth it shall die.&rdquo; There
is nothing we can do for ourselves to commend us to a righteous and holy God.
There is nothing the natural man (fallen away from grace) can offer to appease
God in order to escape His righteous judgement.
</p>
<p>
The Bible describes the fallen nature of man in various terms. Jesus Christ
referred to sinners outside the Kingdom of God as swine and dogs. &ldquo;Give not that
which is holy unto dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample
them under their feet, and turn again and rend you&rdquo; (Matthew 7:6). He also
referred to them as goats (Matthew 25:33). Paul in his epistle to the Philippian
church warned them to beware of evil workers as dogs (Philippians 3:2). Also,
in his epistle to the Romans, he referred to the fallen nature of man as &ldquo;there
is none righteous, no, not one&rdquo;, &ldquo;they are together become unprofitable&rdquo;, &ldquo;their
throat is an open sepulchre&rdquo;, &ldquo;whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness&rdquo;, &ldquo;for
all have sinned and come short of the glory of God&rdquo; (Romans 3:10-18,23). Jesus
and John the Baptist described men as vipers (Matthew 3:7;12:34). Variously,
the unregenerate man is characterised with reprobate mind filled with all
unrighteousness - immorality, covetousness, envy, murder; man is defiled and
polluted (Romans 1:28-32; Mark 7:21-23), treacherous, violent and destructive
(Isaiah 48:8; 59:5-8), cunning and crafty, full of wickedness, blind, foolish, with
darkened understanding, children of wrath, (Ephesians 2:3; 4:14). The Bible
says that the whole man is sick. The heart devises wicked imaginations, and has
come far short of the glory of God. All men have become enslaved to sin: conceived
in sin, born in sin, and lives in sin. By nature and habit, he is a sinner. The
natural man cannot resist sin.
</p>
<p>
The consequence of the Fall is that man became totally depraved, and the
immediate effect was his separation from the Holy God, and the coming into
effect of a curse upon Adam and his descendants (Genesis 3:1-6,14-19,23,24;
Romans 5:12; 8:22). God&rsquo;s judgement also came upon all men: &ldquo;The soul that
sinneth it shall die,&rdquo; &ldquo;for the wages of sin is death&rdquo; (Ezekiel 18:4; Romans 6:23).
The human race has rebelled against God and broken His law, but the love of
God constrained the holy God to plan for man&rsquo;s redemption to fulfil the law that
&ldquo;without the shedding of blood there is no remission&rdquo; (Hebrews 9:22). Therefore,
God undertook the redemption work for man by sending Jesus Christ to die for
him. Jesus Christ became the divine provision of a Perfect Substitute and Sin-
bearer (Genesis 22:7,8,14; Hebrews 9:22; Matthew 1:21). By the perfect sacrifice
of His blood (I Corinthians 5:7) and through His blood, man has complete
protection from the eternal consequence of the Fall, from the curse of the broken
law (Exodus 12:13; Galatians 3:13); complete removal of the guilt and condemnation
of sin, and full redemption by faith in Him (Isaiah 53:4-8; Acts 8:32-35; I Peter 1:18-
21; 2:24).
</p>
<p>
The atonement is the reconciliation of sinful, fallen man to God made possible
through the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The vicarious death of Jesus Christ
is the substitution of the sufferings of Christ for the punishment of all sinners
in the world. The prime purpose of this is the full redemption of fallen mankind.
Through this &ldquo;mercy-seat&rdquo;, sinners are reconciled to God. The power of sin over
the natural man can only be broken by the Lord Jesus Christ (John 1:12;
Romans 5:17-19): &ldquo;For as by one man&rsquo;s disobedience, many were made sinners,
so by the obedience of one man shall many be made righteous.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
God demands repentance from all sinners to avail themselves of the provision
of redemption (Isaiah 53:5-7; Matthew 20:28; 26:28; John 3:14,15; I Corinthians
5:7; John 1:12; 3:18,36) made in Jesus Christ. Repentance is the change which
takes place in the penitent&rsquo;s attitude towards sin. It is turning away from sin
to God. Sincere and total repentance and godly sorrow for sin through the agency
of the Holy Spirit are important pre-requisites for salvation. Repentance is the
deep inward experience which makes the sinner turn from sin to God. Therefore,
God demands repentance from all men (Mark 1:15; Matthew 4:17; Luke 13:3,5;
24:47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 17:30). When a sinner hears the gospel empowered by
the Holy Spirit, the sinner will have deep, godly sorrow for his sins and
acknowledge them by confessing all manner of sins. He goes before God on the
merit of the atonement made by Jesus Christ through His vicarious death and
accepts the sacrifice as a substitute for the punishment of his own personal sins.
On the basis of this genuine repentance, the sinner asks for forgiveness and
pardon based on the promises of God in the scriptures (Proverbs 28:13; Isaiah
55:6,7; I John 1:9; Ezekiel 18:21,22). As the sinner repents genuinely through
the agency of the Holy Spirit he receives pardon (Luke 24:47; John 2:23)."

	"Words" => "Repentance is a conscious turning away from evil, disobedience, sin or idolatry
(Jonah 3:8-10; Proverbs 28:13; Mathew 12:41). It is also turning from Satan unto
the Living God. Repentance evokes a change from one&rsquo;s mind and purpose in
life. It elicits a form of godly sorrow (2 Corinthians 7:10) which makes an erstwhile
sinner regard sin with utter revulsion. Godly sorrow makes the sinner or
backslider to turn away from sin. It also causes an abhorrence or hatred for sin.
The need for repentance is the heartbeat of a deeply compassionate God (2 Peter
3:9). Repentance is the genesis of the process of restoration for backsliders and
salvation of sinners. It differs from tearful remorse which is merely an expression
of sorrow over an embarrassing outcome of sin. It is a universal command by God
to all people (Ezekiel 14:6; 18:30; Acts 17:30,31).
</p>
<p>
Repentance is the central theme of the gospel. The doctrine and teaching of
repentance is fundamental to the propagation of the gospel. It is a foundation
stone in the cardinal doctrines of the New Testament Church. Its vital place in
Scripture, particularly in the New Testament, is underscored by the regularity
of its usage. &ldquo;Repentance&rdquo;, &ldquo;repent&rdquo; or &ldquo;repenting&rdquo; occurs over sixty times in the
New Testament alone.
</p>
<p>
It was the key note of Christ&rsquo;s preaching as well as the sum and substance of
evangelistic, apostolic message. He repeatedly emphasised that His mission was
providing repentance for the sinner (Matthew 9:13; Mark 2:17; Luke 5:32; Acts
3:18,19,26; 11:18). Also, John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord, anchored
his fiery messages in the wilderness on repentance (Luke 3:3-8).
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of His ministry, Jesus preached repentance (Matthew 4:17).
His valedictory message to His disciples shortly before He was taken to heaven,
was hinged upon repentance (Luke 24:45-47). This was principally because
repentance is cardinal to the sinner&rsquo;s reconciliation with God. From His eminent
position in glory, the Lord yet admonished the backslidden church to repent
(Revelation 2:4,5; 3:3). Peter and other Apostles took a cue from the Lord and
made the doctrine of repentance the fundamental theme of their gospel homilies
(Acts 2:38; 3:19). Paul the Apostle, sent to preach to the Gentiles, did not differ
from either the Lord or the other Apostles on the necessity of repentance for the
sinner or backslider to gain the mercy of God (Acts 17:30,31; 20:20,21).
</p>
<p>
Repentance must therefore be preached to all men in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ (Luke 24:47). Sinners and backsliders must be made to know that
no one is excluded from the challenge of the gospel to repent, for it is only through
it that the manifold blessings arising from the remission of sins, could be
appropriated.
</p>
<p>
Repentance, however, does not exist in isolation of faith. Saving faith is taken as
implying the change of mind which is repentance (Hebrews 11:6; Acts 20:21). Both
are a response to grace, creating a completely different orientation for the erstwhile
sinner. Works do not elicit repentance (2 Timothy 1:9; Romans 3:27,28; 4:1-8;
Ephesians 2:8). Paradoxically, repentance must necessarily produce works
otherwise it is unreal (James 2:14-26; Ephesians 2:9,10; Titus 3:8).
</p>
<p>
True repentance manifests in a proper attitude towards sin (2 Corinthians
7:10,11; Psalm 38:18; 51:17; 2 Samuel 12:13). The repentant heart henceforth
treats sin with disdain. No sinner or backslider can be said to have genuinely
repented if he still condones sin. This is because essentially, sin is exceedingly
abominable. Consequently, the need for repentance by the sinner must be the
pivot around which redemption messages must be woven.
</p>
<p>
The practical side of repentance is restitution, which is the act of correcting
all past wrongs and having a conscience void of offence towards God and man.
God expects the repentant sinner or backslider to correct every wrong committed
against others. Restitution is incontrovertibly an integral part of true repentance
(Genesis 20:1-18; Numbers 5:6-8; Ezekiel 33:14-16; Matthew 5:23,24; Acts
24:16). Through repentance, self-centredness gives way to God or Christ-
centredness. The forgiveness of sin is available only to those who repent, for they
alone are worthy of God&rsquo;s mercy.
</p>
<p>
Repentance opens the way and makes us to receive the grace of God. It provides
pardon and remission of sins (Isaiah 55:7; Proverbs 28:13; Luke 24:47; Acts 2:38;
3:19). Through it, sinners receive justification and acceptance (John 1:12,13;
Galatians 3:8; 2:16; Romans 8:1; 5:12). Above all, there is joy in heaven, joy to
God, Christ and heavenly hosts when a sinner repents (Luke 15:7,10). Repentance
is a profitable doctrine that makes inward change and life a reality while
activating a life of faith."

conscience void of offence toward God and men. This is done whether the person
injured knew or not, for God knows (Hebrews 4:13).
</p>
<p>
We receive forgiveness when we confess and forsake our sins. Then, we are
cleansed by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ (Proverbs 28:13; I John 1:9). When
a man sins against God, we often find that other people suffer as a result of that sin.
It is also true that when a man sins against his neighbour, he sins against God in
the same act, because one of God&rsquo;s commandments has been broken. God willingly
forgives the sins committed against Him when there is repentance and forsaking
of sin. However, God requires that a man make amends to any person he has injured
or wronged as a mark among other things, that the repentance is genuine. We need
to bear fruit that signify to all that we have become new creatures indeed (Luke 3:8-
14; Romans 8:1,2; Acts 24:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17). Making restitutions ensures that
we have right relationship with our fellowmen after we are reconciled with God.
</p>
<p>
The Bible doctrine on restitution in precept and practice spans virtually all the
dispensations of God&rsquo;s dealings with men till the present day. The revelation of God&rsquo;s
will and word before the Mosaic laws demands that we make restitution (Romans
1:19-20). Therefore, this teaching or doctrine of God&rsquo;s word which had been
established many years before the law cannot be abolished by the law.
</p>
<p>
Restitution is part of the moral law. Most sins committed by men are against
God as well as their neighbours. So, repentance toward God for the children of Israel
included restoration to man of all properties gained by fraud, lying or pretence of
whatever kind (Exodus 21:18,19,22,26-36; 22:1-15; Leviticus 6:2-5; Numbers 5:6-8).
</p>
<p>
Rulers in Israel reflected and embraced this teaching on restitution. It is vital
today for rulers-temporal and spiritual- to reflect on this commitment to God&rsquo;s moral
requirement for all men (2 Samuel 16:5-8 with 19:16-23; Proverbs 6:30,31; I Kings
20:34).
</p>
<p>
The prophets in Israel also preached, explained and emphasised the need to
make restitution by every backslidden Israelite who is returning to God (Nehemiah
5:6-13). The prophets proclaimed and prophesied much of the coming of Christ and
the atoning sacrifice. They were quick to recognise the need for the blood of the lamb
to cleanse sins; yet, they did not lessen God&rsquo;s requirement of the necessity of
restitution. The ministry of preachers today is akin to that of the Old Testament
prophets.
</p>
<p>
Restitution is a doctrine of Christ, confirming His Word that &ldquo;till heaven and
earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled&rdquo;.
Every believer must earnestly and whole-heartedly contend for, and practice all that
Christ taught (Matthew 18:15-17; Luke 17:3-4; Luke 19:8-10).
</p>
<p>
Zacchaeus&rsquo; encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ is an object lesson. Zacchaeus
wanted nothing to stand between himself and his salvation - not even his wealth,
especially the ill-gotten part of it. Though the people murmured that Jesus was going
to be a sinner&rsquo;s guest, Jesus pronounced that salvation has come to Zacchaeus&rsquo;
house since he, as a son of Abraham, not only by birth but now also by faith, is ready
to make right his life and wholly follow the Lord. The salvation experience makes
a person feel like returning all possessions that rightfully belong to another.
</p>
<p>
The Apostles in the early church also practised and taught restitution. In fact,
the whole church of God lived by this teaching (Matthew 28:19,20; John 14:26; Acts
2:42; 16:4,5; Philemon 7-21). The rules of righteous living are just as high (or even
higher) under the dispensation of grace as those in the Old Testament. Restitution
is as much a part of the Gospel as conversion or water baptism. It is not a self-
righteous act to merit pardon. When a man is saved, he will not only make right
matters of money such as theft, dishonest gains and unpaid bills; he will also confess
his lies, slanderous reports, unjust criticisms, hatred, malice - those things in which
one may have injured others in word or deed. One may say, &ldquo;my brother or sister
does not know that I talked evil of him.&rdquo; But what about the person to whom you
talked? Without doubt, you have harmed him, and perhaps he repeated it to others.
You should go to the one to whom you talked and confess it. It is better that we make
right all previous wrongs here and now than face it in eternity (I Timothy 5:24).
</p>
<p>
Making restitution can be likened to a spiritual warfare in which we need God&rsquo;s
help and wisdom to undertake for us and quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
(Ephesians 6:10-12,16). Some restitutions are delicate. These are restitutions that
may implicate or bring injuries or harm to others that may be unsaved; or the need
to settle issues with individuals or organisations that may affect other people in an
adverse way. It also includes cases in which we don&rsquo;t have clear leading from God&rsquo;s
word as to what steps to take. For delicate restitutions, we need fervent
prayerfulness, wisdom and counselling from Spirit-filled preachers of God&rsquo;s word
who believe and teach the whole counsel of God (Proverbs 11:14; 15:22; 24:6).
</p>
<p>
The civil laws in a country may not always govern in matters of restitution. For
example, the law may provide a time limit for certain classes of debts and obligations,
after which they become lapse; but no debts are outlawed with God. Time cannot
cancel moral obligations.
</p>
<p>
Restitution is usually considered at the time of salvation because God will only
forgive when a man is willing, so far as it lies within his power, to make right every
wrong that he has committed against others. There would be need however
throughout life as a Christian to be ready to make restitution where need be when
others are offended, for example, out of human error of judgment (Acts 23:1-5,
Matthew 5:23,24).
</p>
<p>
God demands that restitutions be made. A far reaching benefit in God&rsquo;s plan as
regards restitution is that an undeniable testimony is directed to people who
otherwise might never seriously hear the story of the gospel. A religion that compels
a man to pay his just debts, restore back the things he has stolen, and uncover his
crimes demands confidence from men of the world.
</p>
<p>
When restitutions are made, and past wrongs are settled, the peace of God floods
the believer&rsquo;s heart. There is confidence towards God in prayer and the believer makes progress in the Christian life as sense of guilt is removed (Romans 8:1,2)."

basis of any personal merit but in the light of what Christ had accomplished
for mankind by His substitutionary death on the cross at Calvary (Psalm 32:1,2;
Isaiah 1:18; Micah 7:19; Acts 13:38).
</p>
<p>
In order to fully appreciate the benefits of salvation in Christ Jesus, the
utter helplessness and hopelessness of man should be noted. The need for
justification becomes necessary as man is incapable of personally providing a
solution to his problem of sin or change his eternal destiny of damnation
(Isaiah 59:8).
</p>
<p>
To meet the standard of divine justice, due price needed to be paid. Man
lacked both the capacity and purity to afford this. It therefore required the
sacrifice of the spotless Lamb of God, to pay the necessary ransom with His
blood for the expiation of man&rsquo;s sins.
</p>
<p>
It is instructive here to note that the nature of sin is not such that man
could handle on his own or by the merit of his works (Ephesians 2:8,9). Just
as circumcision cannot justify the Jew nor water baptism the Gentile, so can
church membership or confirmation not justify anyone by the standards of
God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness. Only faith in the atoning work of Jesus
Christ on the cross can assure a penitent soul of full justification. Three as-
pects of the doctrinal question need be examined closely namely, redemption
by the blood of Christ, necessity of faith, and evidence of justification.
</p>
<p>
Though physically present in the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve died spiri-
tually and became alienated from God and from the commonwealth of His
kingdom, after eating the forbidden fruit. Christ therefore became the sin-
Bearer, based on the fact of God&rsquo;s provision and promises of the Scripture
(Romans 3:24,25). And He is &ldquo;the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world&rdquo; (1 John 2:2; Acts 4:12). By Christ&rsquo;s finished work of grace, solution was provided to the problem of sin to ensure man&rsquo;s reconciliation with God (Isaiah 44:22; Romans 5:9).
</p>
<p>
Although Christ&rsquo;s atonement on the cross guarantees universal provision of
salvation for all mankind, this could only be appropriated on personal basis
through faith in Christ Jesus. The sinner who seeks salvation must take the
necessary step of exercising faith in the blood of Jesus. Apostle Paul gives
proof of it in his Epistle to the Romans 5:1. &ldquo;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;. And to the
Jewish Christians he writes &ldquo;For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed
with faith in them that heard it&rdquo; (Hebrews 4:2).
</p>
<p>
Having been saved through faith in our Lord Jesus, the redeemed should
have evidence to show for his justification (2 Corinthians 5:17). Before he was
justified, the sinner was plagued by the works of the flesh as catalogued in
Galatians 5:19-21. But in those that have been made a new creature, the
fruits of the Spirit become manifest (Galatians 5:22,23). Therefore, in life-
style, speech, conduct and disposition, the redeemed is more like Christ, hav-
ing been quickened by the Spirit of God.
</p>
<p>
The misleading conception of justification by works as an article of man&rsquo;s
religion is opposed to justification by faith because it denies the grace of God
and dishonours the blood of Christ.
</p>
<p>
The reference in the General Epistle of James 2:14-26 may be interpreted
amiss by a cursory reader of Scriptures, where it asks: &ldquo;But wilt thou know,
O vain man, that faith without work is dead?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
The underlying point being stressed by James is that &lsquo;works&rsquo; as referred to,
in this context are a complement of justification by faith. Whereas Apostle
Paul&rsquo;s epistle to the Romans, chapter 4, is essentially doctrinal, and the prac-
tice is based upon the doctrine; that of James is essentially practical, the
doctrinal element being purely incidental.
</p>
<p>
So, though in one sense a man is justified by faith without works, in an-
other sense, we see &ldquo;how by works a man is justified, and not by faith
only.&rdquo; Justification is by faith before God but by works before men. Properly
understood, none is really mutually exclusive."

$doctrines[] = array("Title" => "Water Baptism",
       "Heading" => "That water Baptism is essential to our obedience after reconciliation with God. Water Baptism is one immersion (not three) &ldquo;In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&rdquo;, as Jesus
       commanded",
       "Citation" => "Matthew 28:19; 3:13-17; Mark 16:15,16; Acts 2:38;8:38,39; 19:1-5; Romans 6:4,5.",

yet one of the most misunderstood teachings by contemporary teachers and
preachers. Some, at one extreme, believe that it is not necessary because of its
abuse by nominal Christians while on the other extreme, others believe that
without water baptism, one cannot be saved. In the middle is yet another group
that believes that, though it is necessary, it must be administered in the name
of Jesus only.
</p>
<p>
All of them are wrong because Jesus Christ commanded that water baptism
should be administered in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19). Doing otherwise, therefore, is to disobey Jesus
Christ.
</p>
<p>
The word &lsquo;baptize&rsquo; is a Greek word &lsquo;baptiso&rsquo; which means to immerse, &lsquo;dip
inside liquid&rsquo;. This shows the proper form of baptism by immersion inside water.
The immersion signifies identification with the burial of Christ in His death and
rising up in newness of life with Him at His resurrection (Romans 6:3-5;
Colossians 2:12). In baptism, the believer shows his faith that Christ died for
his sins and rose again for his justification: that if he dies he will be raised again
in the resurrection; and that he dies to his old life and rises to walk in the new
life with Christ.
</p>
<p>
The immersion is done only ONCE and not THRICE. Jesus Christ was dipped
inside River Jordan only once (Matthew 3:16); the Eunuch of Ethiopia was
immersed in water once (Acts 8:38).
</p>
<p>
When we submit for water baptism, it is an acknowledgment of Christ in a
public way. Therefore, it is a public ceremony which witnesses to all that one
has put on Christ (Galatians 3:27).
</p>
<p>
Jesus commanded that sinners be preached to, and as they repent and
believe the gospel, they should be baptized. This confirms that water baptism
is for those who fully repent of their sins (Acts 2:38). This also confirms that it
is only adults who can exercise faith to believe that can be baptized (Matthew
28:19; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47; Romans 10:9,10; Acts 20:20,21; Mark 1:14,15).
It is fundamentally wrong to baptize infants who have not reached the stage of
accountability, as it&rsquo;s being practised by some orthodox churches.
</p>
<p>
The pages of the New Testament are filled with references on water baptism.
In Matthew 3:13-17, Jesus Christ submitted Himself to John the Baptist for
water baptism to fulfil all righteousness. The testimony of God the Father to the
ministry of His Son, Jesus Christ, through the descent of the Holy Ghost on Him
as He came out of the water after the water baptism was in agreement with it.
Christ&rsquo;s command of Matthew 28:19 was re-echoed in Mark 16:16. The Apostles
also continued to baptize in obedience to the command of Christ: the converts
on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:37-42,47); Eunuch of Ethiopia (Acts 8:36,37),
Samaritan converts (Acts 8:12,13), Cornelius and his kinsmen (Acts 10:47,48);
the Philippian Jailor (Acts 16:30-33); the Ephesian disciples (Acts 19:5).
</p>
<p>
Salvation does not come through water baptism but by grace through faith
in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ (Ephesian 1:7; 2:8,9; I John 1:7,9; Hebrews
9:22; Matthew 26:28; John 1:12; 3:16,17; I Peter 3:21). The Scripture records
a catalogue of those who got saved without water baptism being a pre-condition:
the sick of the palsy healed by Jesus Christ (Matthew 9:1-7); the woman who
washed the feet of Jesus with her tears and cleansed them with her hair (Luke
7:36-50); Zacchaeus (Luke 19:1-10); the thief on the cross (Luke 23:39-43);
Eunuch of Ethiopia (Acts 8:30-37); those who believed in Antioch (Acts 11:20,21).
Saul of Tarsus was addressed as &lsquo;Brother Saul&rsquo; by Ananias before he submitted
himself for water baptism (Acts 9:17)
</p>
<p>
Jesus has laid down the standard for water baptism and it is to be carried out
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19).
Every believer, in obedience to Christ&rsquo;s command, should therefore submit to
this ordinance of water baptism. The importance of water baptism was expressed
by Jesus Christ in His parting words. He said, &rdquo;<b>He that believeth and is
BAPTIZED shall be saved</b>&ldquo;.
</p>
<p>
The opinion of men cannot contradict the stand of the Scripture (Matthew
28:19). Once a person repents of his sin, it is mandatory that he submits himself
for water baptism as provided for in the scriptures (Romans 6:3,4). The practice
was upheld in the early church. Converts were baptized in water soon after their
salvation experience (Acts 2:41; 8:37,38; 16:30,31,33). Every convert is therefore
enjoined to yield to this important injunction. God-ordained church leaders
must do their utmost best to encourage their flocks to attach great importance
to this practice (Acts 20:28). Like Peter did, church leaders must encourage their
hearers to &rdquo;<b>repent and be BAPTISED ... for the remission of sin ...</b>&ldquo;."

	"Words" => "The institution of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is clearly shown in the gospels (Matthew
26:17-30; Luke 22:1,7-20). Paul amplified the doctrine in I Corinthians 11:20-30. In
the gospel according to Saint Luke, we see the links between the Feast of Passover
or Unleavened Bread and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (Luke 22:15-20).
</p>
<p>
The Lord&rsquo;s Supper in the New Testament is a type of the Feast of the Passover
or Unleavened Bread in the Old Testament (Exodus 12:1-28,40-51). This implies that
just as the vicarious death of the Lord Jesus Christ replaced the sacrifice of the
Aaronic or Levitical priesthood for atonement of sin, for us Christians, the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper has replaced the Feast of the Passover, as an ordinance.
</p>
<p>
Some churches refer to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as the &ldquo;SACRAMENT&rdquo; (Latin -
sacramentum, meaning Holy Ordinance (I Corinthians 11:2). The Theologians call
it the &ldquo;EUCHARIST&rdquo; (Greek - GIVING OF THANKS), still others name it &ldquo;THE LORD&rsquo;S
TABLE&rdquo; or the &ldquo;HOLY COMMUNION&rdquo; (I Corinthians 10:16). Those who participate in
eating of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper are called the &ldquo;Communicants&rdquo;. The universal name is
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as used by our Lord.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the fact that the Lord&rsquo;s Supper has replaced the Feast of the Passover,
if we apply the LAW OF FIRST MENTION as a means of studying the doctrine at hand,
vital lessons and inspiration can be drawn from critically looking at the pattern of
the celebration of the Feast of Passover in Exodus 12:1-51; Deuteronomy 16:1-8 and
2 Chronicles 30:1-27.
</p>
<p>
This can be accomplished if we ask ourselves and answer the following questions:
(i) When and why was the Passover instituted? (ii) Who was qualified to partake in
the ordinance? (iii) What were the tokens or emblems employed in the service? (iv)
Who officiated in the service and how did they prepare for the ordinance i.e. place,
provision, cost and personal sacrifices? (v) What was the spiritual impact and how
often was it done? Parallel questions and answers apply to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
</p>
<p>
The PASSOVER (Hebrew &lsquo;Pesah&rsquo;) means &ldquo;to pass over&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;to spare&rdquo; (Exodus
12:13,27). The Israelites were in bondage in Egypt (Exodus 2:11). They cried unto
the Lord for deliverance (Exodus 3:7-10). Pharaoh did not set them free until God
sent vicious plagues upon Egypt. The Passover ordinance was instituted the night
when the destroyer killed Egyptians&rsquo; first born but &ldquo;passed over&rdquo; or spared the Jews
because of the blood on the lintel and side posts of their doors (a type of Calvary&rsquo;s
Cross). The Feast of Unleavened Bread was co-joined with that of the Passover. The
two then became known as &ldquo;The Passover&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 16:1-8). Sanctified elders
and the priests handled the emblems (the blood of pure lamb and unleavened bread).
The lamb was to be roasted and not eaten raw. No bone of the lamb was broken (Exodus
12:46; John 1:29; 19:36). This typifies Christ. The defiled, uncircumcised strangers
and Gentiles did not participate (Exodus 12:43-49).
</p>
<p>
However, a qualified person would be cut off from among the Israelites if he
refused to eat the Passover (Numbers 9:13). The Jews who did not observe it in the
first month because they were not levitically pure, a second chance of eating the
Passover was offered in the second month, if they were clean (Deuteronomy 16:1-
8; 2 Chronicles 30:1-27).
</p>
<p>
The preparations made in terms of personal and corporate cleansing, provision
of the emblems and the place for the ordinance were elaborate and thorough. History
tells us that in the New Testament, a candle light search was made to root out any
trace of leaven (impurity) from the location of the Passover. The HALLEL, Psalm 113
to 118 was sung (Matthew 26:30) and the story of Exodus 12:1-14 recounted, bringing
to remembrance the deliverance from Egypt. Prayers were also offered. It was a holy
convocation. For the Jews, the dates for the Passover now became the beginning of
months. It is to be observed forever as a memorial. It brought joy and renewed
strength to God&rsquo;s people (2 Chronicles 30:25,26).
</p>
<p>
However, by the deeds of the law no man shall be justified. By the time of Christ,
the Passover activities had been commercialised (John 2:13-17).
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ instituted the Lord&rsquo;s Supper at the last Passover, for New Testament
believers, thus signifying the end of the latter (Luke 22:1-20). Our Lord Jesus Christ
is our Paschal Lamb or Passover (I Corinthians 5:7). He has delivered us from all
bondages, sin, sickness and Satan.
</p>
<p>
In I Corinthians 11:27-32, no unbeliever, fornicator, polygamist or drunkard could
join in the breaking of bread. The syncretic and the occultic did not have part in it.
Some become unworthy because of fighting, keeping malice, divisive attitude, and
having unforgiving spirit. Any restitution should be settled before the hour of the
ordinance (Matthew 5:23,24).
</p>
<p>
The Lord&rsquo;s Supper is not the common love feast or marriage reception food (I
Corinthians 11:20-22). We DISCERN the Lord&rsquo;s Body during participation in the
Lord&rsquo;s supper (I Corinthians 11:29). This implies we recognise that the emblems, &rdquo;</b>the
fruit of the vine<b>&ldquo; and the &rdquo;<b>unleavened Bread&rdquo;</b> REPRESENT or SYMBOLISE the Lord&rsquo;s
broken body and His blood that was shed respectively. They are not the actual body
and blood of Jesus Christ. This calls for holiness of life and solemnity on our part
as we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table. We take the emblems to SHEW FORTH the Lord&rsquo;s
death. We call to remembrance His love and passion on Calvary&rsquo;s Cross. The Lord&rsquo;s
Supper is to be taken as often as practicable, in remembrance of our Lord till He
comes (Matthew 26:17-21,26-30; Luke 22:7-13; I Corinthians 11:26). We look forward
to the Rapture and the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9). Adequate
preparations should be made by the leadership of the church to secure the emblems
and a location for the ordinance. More importantly, we must keep our total being
worthy for it.
</p>
<p>
In a Bible-believing church, grave consequences can befall those who eat it
unworthily. Weakness, sickness or even death could ensue (I Corinthians 11:30).
If you always feel disqualified, it is not certain that you will be qualified for the
Rapture and the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7,8). Adults, youths and
children who have current testimony of salvation and holy living can partake of it."

       "Words" => "The doctrine of entire sanctification is central in the mind of the God-head. The
doctrine is at the hub or nucleus of Christian teaching. What then is the meaning
of the word, Sanctification? Sanctification is an English word which means: to make
sacred or holy; to set apart for a holy or religious use; to make free from sin; to cleanse
from moral corruption and pollution; the act of God&rsquo;s grace by which the affections
of men are purified or alienated from sin and the world, and exalted to supreme love
to God; to purify in order to prepare for divine service and for partaking of holy things;
to free from the power of sin; being set free from the power of cancelled sin. It is a
gracious work of the Holy Spirit - not of works, not of growth, not of death, not of
purgatory - in those who are already in Christ. Sanctification is an operation of the
Spirit of God. Those who have been regenerated and recreated in Christ, must of
necessity be sanctified through the virtue of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and
by His Word and His Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Sanctification is an instantaneous experience given to a believer to enable him
cleave to God without the tendency to want to go astray or go away from the Lord.
It is not a protracted or tedious process of growth. You do not grow INTO
sanctification, but you can grow IN sanctification. We can never grow into what God
must of necessity do for us. Again, sanctification is not brought about by death: to
assume that is to say that death is no longer our last enemy to be destroyed (I
Corinthians 15:26). Neither are we cleansed from the original stain (the nature we
brought into the world) through Water Baptism. Entire sanctification is not of works,
but it is the work of God, divinely wrought by the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Holiness&rsquo;, &lsquo;Perfection&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sanctification&rsquo; are the definitive terms used
interchangeably. Holiness means entire freedom from sin; wholeness, spiritual
health, moral integrity and purity. Therefore, holiness means the absence of sin
(Luke 1:74,75; Psalm 93:5; I Peter 1:16; Hebrews 12:14). &lsquo;Perfection&rsquo; means that
which is not lacking in that which it ought to have. The perfection which God requires
and accomplishes in those who earnestly ask in faith is the purifying of our hearts
to love every believer as Christ loves us, and to love our neighbours as ourselves.
Nothing less than this is desirable and nothing more is required (Colossians 1:28).
Entire sanctification is described as &lsquo;clean heart&rsquo; or &lsquo;pure heart&rsquo;. This descriptive
term shows the experience in a way one can understand when it takes place in his
heart (Psalm 24:3,4; Matthew 5:8). The Bible teaches that all of God&rsquo;s children can
be like Jesus in separation from the world, in purity and in love. We must be inwardly
pure and peaceful in order not to suffer defeat in our Christian life. A blameless
life is a life in which God sees nothing to condemn. We may not be blameless to our
contemporaries, but we can be blameless before God. God examines a sanctified
heart and expects to always find all that it possesses to be in harmony with Himself.
The heart of the sanctified is a throne on which God reigns without a rival; an empire
wherein He exercises unchecked, undisputed dominion and authority.
</p>
<p>
How does the earnest seeker get sanctified? There must first be a definite
separation and withdrawal from all sins and appearance of evil, immorality and all
unclean things (I Thessalonians 5:22; 2 Corinthians 6:17; 2 Timothy 2:21). There
must, second, be entire consecration. This is giving ourselves unto God in a vivid
manner. First, we give ALL we are to God. Here, we no longer lay any claim to
ourselves (Luke 9:60; Romans 12:1-2). Second, we give our body unto the glory of
God, not for any selfish motive or purpose in view, but with the consideration and
knowledge that we are bought by the precious blood of Jesus. Third, we give ourselves
for service (John 13:12-17). We should not only stress our being priests and kings
unto God but also as being servants. Here, Jesus shows us how to consecrate and
dedicate ourselves for service. Washing the feet was the work of a slave. So, we
must learn to do the meanest job in the midst of believers and not waiting for
compliments. Fourth, we must die to self. <b>&ldquo;Verily, verily I say unto you, Except
a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth
forth much fruit&rdquo;</b> (John 12:24,25). To consecrate is to come before God with our past,
present, future personality, possession, wisdom, talent, intellect, money, influence,
position in the family and in the church and dedicate all to Him. When we separate
and dedicate ourselves unto God, He is readily willing to do His part and give us the
definite experience of Entire Sanctification. This is the operation of God, a definite
act of God&rsquo;s grace in believers&rsquo; hearts (Hebrews 2:11; 13:12,13).
</p>
<p>
By what means of grace does the believer get into this experience? The means
of sanctification includes: (a) the word of God (John 15:3); (b) the blood of Jesus
(Hebrews 13:12,13); (c) Faith in the Lord (Acts 26:18); (d) the Spirit of God, and (e)
God Himself (I Thessalonians 2:23). We do not get sanctified by studying the Word
alone. We need to pray in faith for the experience. We must believe in its possibility
before we can ask in faith. Also, we must realise that it is the will of God that we
are made holy (I Thessalonians 4:3-8; I John 5:14,15). Without holiness, no man shall
see the Lord. Holiness here is not just the judicial kind of holiness, but the practical
holiness of which believers are partakers because they have surrendered their
entire life unto God through Christ. This holiness does something in our hearts and
it makes us live right. We must desire it (Mark 11:24), and ask with a genuine burning
desire.
</p>
<p>
What should be our response to this doctrine? The Bible teaches that all believers
can be wholly sanctified (I Thessalonians 5:23). We should not be guilty of taking
away from the Word. This teaching places a great and solemn responsibility upon
all preachers of the Word to teach this doctrine; be a partaker of the experience (I
Timothy 4:12; 2 Timothy 2:6); endeavour to understand and know it through diligent
study (2 Timothy 2:15; Titus 1:9); faithfully and effectively teach all believers without
fear or compromise, for in all things of the Spirit, we should not withhold or withdraw
the truth from our congregation (2 Timothy 2:2). Let us encourage all believers to
partake of the blessing. This gracious Christian experience could be kept all through
life provided that the recipient keeps abiding in Christ, watching and praying (John
15:4; Mark 13:32-35). Thus, believer must not grieve the Holy Spirit, or relapse into
bitterness and harshness of spirit (Ephesians 4:30,31). He must not allow or engage
in unprofitable conversation (Ephesians 5:3,4), unkind criticisms, evil speaking and
fault finding, self-indulgence, prejudice, impatience, indolence, negligence,
uncontrolled temperament, self-dependence and self-management. He must avoid
developing or showing interest in objects of temptation.
</p>
<p>
Why should any Christian doubt the possibility of complete deliverance from sin?
Jesus should not be limited as a Saviour. Complete deliverance from sin is Christ&rsquo;s
purpose (Titus 2:11-15). The white lily grows up from a mire, but with no dust on it.
Christians can grow up in this dirty world yet without spot on their lives (Romans
12:1,2). It is our privilege to be totally separated from this evil of the world. It is a
promise from God that we should be purged and sanctified. <b>&ldquo;Faithful is He that
calleth you, who also will do it&rdquo;</b> (I Thessalonians 5:24)."

sanctification of His disciples and yet commanded them to wait for the enduement
of power, the Baptism with the Holy Spirit. Moreover, sanctification is for purity

The Holy Spirit is not a mere impersonal force. He is not a mere power that we
can get hold of and use. He is not a mere influence that we feel. He is a person who
seeks to get hold of us and use us. The Holy Spirit is a Divine Personality who we
must honour, worship, fellowship with and listen to. He is called the Holy Ghost, the
Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, the Spirit of the Living God, the Spirit of Christ, the
Spirit of Holiness, the Spirit of Life, the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of your Father,
the Comforter, the Eternal Spirit (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Luke 11:13;
Hebrews 9:14; I Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 3:3; I Peter 1:11; 4:14; Romans 1:4;
8:2). The Holy Ghost is eternal, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, and holy. He
is the Inspirer of the Holy Scriptures, the General Overseer of the militant Church,
the Great Teacher, Helper and Guide of all the saints, the character Builder of all
members of the Body of Christ (Hebrews 9:14; Psalm 139:7-10; Acts 10:38; Matthew
12:28; I Corinthians 2:10,11; John 14:17-26; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Galatians 5:22,23).

meet God&rsquo;s conditions can receive God&rsquo;s abundance (Isaiah 44:3; Ezekiel 36:25-27;
Joel 2:28,29; John 7:37-39. Few (very few) of the Old Testament saints had the bulk
of theSpirit upon them for some special tasks that the Lord gave them to do. The rest
majority of the Israelites lived all their lives without the &ldquo;special privilege&rdquo; of having
&ldquo;the Spirit upon&rdquo; them. Even those who had this privilege did not all enjoy His
continuous abiding presence (Numbers 11:25; 24:2; Judges 3:10; 6:34; 14:6; I Samuel
10:9,10; 16:13; 2 Peter 1:21).

There were great expectations and a &ldquo;diligent searching&rdquo; by the Old Testament
prophets. They looked forward to the glorious Gospel days in which we live. Even the
angels dared to look into these things.

In as much as Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, birth, life, dominion, rejection, suffering,
meekness, death and resurrection were all foretold, and the messianic prophecies
were fulfilled in every detail, so also, will all prophecies concerning the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit must be fulfilled.

2.&nbsp; We receive &ldquo;a new heart&rdquo;, &ldquo;an heart of flesh&rdquo;, renewal of &ldquo;the stony heart&rdquo;, &ldquo;circumcision of heart&rdquo; (Ezekiel 36:26,27).<br/>
3.&nbsp; We have &ldquo;faith&rdquo; to &ldquo;receive&rdquo; (Galatians 3:2,14; Mark 11:22,24).<br/>

called a ransom. It simply connotes buying back unto freedom someone in servitude,
slavery or captivity. The fall of man brought all human race under sin, Satan and
condemnation. This was the result of man&rsquo;s disobedience to God, and the
consequence of the broken law. Man lost his purity and favour with God in the fall.
Man cannot, by himself, regain it. The whole creation was brought under the curse
and all men (in Adam) became sinners and captives to sin, Satan and sickness
(Romans 5:12). Consequently, man being under the sentence of death, could not pay
his own death penalty and live again to enjoy freedom from sin and carry out the
divine purpose for which he has been created. God then undertook the redemption
of man by sending His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ to die in man&rsquo;s place. He, being
capable, of redeeming man, met the demands of the law and became the legal
substitute by paying the redemptive price for those who are condemned to death for
breaking the law. This is absolute protection from eternal punishment through the
blood of the perfect and spotless substitute (Exodus 12:13; John 3:16; Ephesians 1:7;
Romans 3:24; Revelation 5:9; Romans 8:3; Isaiah 53:4-8; I Corinthians 6:20; 7:23;
Matthew 26:28; I Peter 1:18-21). It is Christ who bore the curse of the law and
suffered its condemnation of death in our stead. No sinner can be acquitted except
he accepts Christ as his Redeemer (Acts. 4:12).
</p>
<p>
Man&rsquo;s redemption is not limited to removal of guilt; it covers all consequences
of the broken law which are sickness, disease and satanic oppression. Healing of
sickness and disease as well as continued health are provided for all men through
the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. In the Old Testament, there was a divine plan
by which God heals all those who were in covenant relationship with Him. It is not
everyone that can enjoy this unfailing healing and health plan made by God for all
mankind based on the fact that not all men are in covenant relationship with Him.
The promise to keep the Israelites from diseases by which the Egyptians were
afflicted was made at the instance of the healing covenant Israel made with God.
Diverse sickness, pestilences and plagues came upon them when they disobeyed
God and broke His covenant (Deuteronomy 28:28-61; Psalm 107:17-20). But when
they repented and prayed, fulfilling the covenant conditions, they were healed
(Numbers 21:4-9; 2 Chronicles 7:13,14; Psalm 107:17-20). God is in the business of
healing today where the conditions of the covenant are met.
</p>
<p>
Jesus not only bore our sins, He also bore our sickness and diseases. He became
our sickness-Bearer in exactly the same way He became our sin-Bearer. Christ was
scourged and striped for our healing; nailed to the cross for our sin (John 3:14; 12:22-
23; Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:16,17; Psalm 103:2,4). The Holy Spirit concluded by
saying, <b>&ldquo;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law &rdquo;</b> (sickness - pestilence,
fever, cancer, ulcer, boils, as well as nameless sicknesses found in people&rsquo;s life today
and other infirmities recorded or not recorded in scriptures) (Deuteronomy 28:15-
29,58-61; Galatians 3:13; Deuteronomy 7:12-15). Christ has been made manifest
to destroy the works of the devil (I John 3:8; Acts 10:38; Hebrews 13:8).
</p>
<p>
Divine healing and health, like salvation has remained the right of every child
of God. It is a vital part of complete salvation once we belong to the commonwealth
of Israel and not strangers to the covenant of promise (Matthew 15:26-28; Ephesians
2:12-21; I Peter 2:9,10). Sickness in whatever form is of the devil. God calls it captivity
(Job 42:10), Jesus calls it bondage (Luke 13:16,12) and the Holy Spirit calls it
oppression (Acts 10:38). The victory of Jesus is our victory. He did nothing for Himself.
He conquered sin, Satan, disease and sickness on our behalf. He shares His victory
with all who will repent and believe on His name. He bore our infirmities, sicknesses
and diseases so that we could claim full release and deliverance. But disobedience
to God&rsquo;s word, misuse of tongue and unbelief will make the covenant of no effect.
For the people of God, no more can anyone enjoy the blessing of healing without a
current relationship with God through Christ, obedience to the Word of God and
fulfilling the terms and conditions for healing (Exodus 15:26; 23:25,26; Deuteronomy
7:12-15,6-9; Psalm 91; Isaiah 1:19; Mark 2:5,9,11; 3 John 2).
</p>
<p>
It then goes without saying that &ldquo;curse causeless shall not come ....&rdquo; Most often,
infirmities come as a consequence of disobeying God (Genesis 20:1-18; I Chronicles
10:13), through Satan, the very source of sickness and affliction (Job 2:6,7; Matthew
4:23,24; John 10:10; 8:44; 5:14; Acts 10:38), backsliding (2 Chronicles 16:12-14;
Matthew 12:43-45), misuse of the tongue (Numbers 21:4-6; 11:1-3; 12:1-10), sin,
covetousness or merchandising God&rsquo;s gift (2 Kings 5:20-27); rebellion (Psalm 107:17-
20; Deuteronomy 32:39-41) or even breaking God&rsquo;s law of nature. The Scripture reveals
that evil spirits, devils and demons also assist Satan in its destructive work on human
bodies. They possess, oppress, afflict, torment, obsess people and cause dumbness and
deafness (Matthew 9:32,33; Mark 9:25-27), blindness (Matthew 12:22), grievous
vexation and torments (Matthew 15:22), lunacy (Matthew 4:24; Luke 9:38-42) and
suicide (Matthew 17:15). Satan and his cohorts gain entrance into men when men
sin, consult with familiar spirits, practise palm reading, magic, witchcraft, fortune
telling, not guarding the mind or refusal to resist the devil. As long as you have any
of the devil&rsquo;s property, he will stay around you. Renounce and destroy the works of
the devil for total emancipation from his claws (1 Peter 1:1,13; 5:8,9; Acts 19:18,19).
</p>
<p>
The Bible sets forth the conditional precedence to enjoying the benefits and blessings
of our relationship with God, which are our redemptive rights: genuine conversion (Psalm
103:2-5; Matthew 13:15; Mark 9:23; Matthew 21:21,22; Mark 11:22-24; John 14:12; James
1:6-8), obedience to God and His Word (Exodus 15:26; 23:25,26; Proverbs 4:20-22); abiding
in Him (Psalm 91:1-7; John 15:1-7); making peace with fellow men (Mark 11:22-26; James
5:14-16; Genesis 20:14), serving God in holiness (Exodus 23:25,26; Colossians 2:6,7; John
5:14; I John 3:21-22), and appropriating the benefits of Calvary through prayer of faith (2
Peter 1:3,4; Hebrews 6:18; I Peter 2:24; James 1:16,17; Hebrews 13:8; Matthew 8:17). From
the foregoing, God heals those who are under His healing covenant (Psalm 105:37; 2
Chronicles 30:18-20) by His Word (Psalm 107:20; Hebrews 4:12; Matthew 8:8), through His
Mercy (Matthew 20:30-34), by His Power (Matthew 28:18; Colossians 1:16,17; Luke 5:17),
by His Spirit (Acts 10:38; Isaiah 61:1,2; Luke 10:18,19; Romans 8:2,11; Matthew 12:28), in
His Name (Acts 3:6; Luke 10:17,18; Mark 16:17,18; Proverbs 18:10; Philippians 2:9-11), by
His Will (I John 5:14,15; John 5:30; 3 John 2). What a sure word of prophecy! No need therefore
for private interpretation; according to your faith it shall be done unto you.
</p>
<p>
It is then left with every believer to fulfil the terms of the divine conditions in order
to live in the reality of this marvellous provision. Healing and health is for us today.
We can lay claim boldly to this redemptive grace: not with uncertainty, but with
confidence of faith and prayer to get healed and remain healthy all the days of our
lives. Now, we are redeemed, purchased, bought back again to be God&rsquo;s peculiar
possession (Acts 20:28; I Corinthians 6:20; 7:23; Obadiah 17). We shall live to possess our possession."

	"Heading" => "That Personal Evangelism is a God-given and God-ordained ministry for every believer. Jesus commanded and God requires every believer to be a compassionate and fruitful soulwinner, bringing others to Christ",
	"Citation" => "Matthew 28:19,20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-49; John 17:18; Acts 1:8; 1-4; Psalm 126:5,6; Proverbs 11:30; Daniel 12:3; Ezekiel 3:17-21.",
       	"Words" => "Personal Evangelism is a God-given and God-ordained ministry for every believer.
The Greek word &ldquo;evangellion&rdquo; (gospel) actually means Good News. It is good news
from a loving God to a lost world that, through the death, burial and resurrection
of Christ, there is salvation (John 3:16,17). Personal evangelism is the person-to-
person sharing of this good news of salvation with the aim of soul-winning - leading
the sinner to repent and turn wholly to God through Jesus Christ, the Saviour (John
1:40-42; Acts 8:26-37). Jesus commanded and God requires every believer to be a
compassionate and fruitful soul-winner (Matthew 28:19,20; Mark 16:15; Acts 1:8).
Although mass evangelism is good and necessary, it will never take the place of
personal evangelism. Illustrating the efficacy and superiority of personal evangelism,
one godly man said, &ldquo;If you had one hundred empty bottles before you, and threw
a pail of water over them, some would get a little in them, but most would fall outside.
If you wish to fill the bottles, the best way is to take each bottle separately and put
a vessel full of water to each bottle&rsquo;s mouth&rdquo;. Another man of God said, &ldquo;The world
is never going to be brought to Christ whole-sale, but one by one. Men are not born
collectively, they do not die collectively, they do not accept or reject Christ
collectively.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Personal evangelism is essential and mandatory because (a) Jesus commanded
it (Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:19,20); (b) God is happy with its result (Luke 15:10); (c)
Jesus did it (John 4:21-30; Matthew 4:19); (d) God the Father started it (Genesis 3:9);
(e) Jesus prayed for the believers&rsquo; sanctification to make personal evangelism
effective (John 17:17,18); (f) The Holy Spirit is given because of it (Acts 1:8); (g) Jesus
Christ willed it (Matthew 4:19); (h) It is the heart desire of God (Ezekiel 33:11; 2 Peter
3:9); (i) Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry illustrates it (Luke 19:10); (j) The early apostolic
church practised it (Acts 8:30-37; Mark 16:20; Acts 8:4); (k) It is a mark of true wisdom
(Proverbs 11:30); (l) Every genuine believer is equipped for it (John 1:37-45; 4:28,29);
(m) It is the primary purpose for our salvation (John 15:16; 20:21); (n) There is great
reward for those who carry it out (Daniel 12:3); (o) The harvest is plenteous but
labourers are few (Matthew 9:36,37; John 4:35-38); (p) Life is short while eternity
is endless (John 9:4; I Corinthians 7:29-31); (q) Souls are precious to God (Matthew
16:26; Mark 8:36,37; Psalm 49:6-9); (r) Hell is the end of all who die in sin (Mark 9:43-
48; Psalm 9:17; Revelation 20:10-15); (s) Powers of darkness and cults are growing
(2 Timothy 3:13; I Timothy 4:1); (t) Neglect hinders prayers and progress (Proverbs
21:13; 24:11,12); (u) It can be done without any expense. No loudspeakers and
microphones are needed. No permission from the government, church or school is
needed for the use of their compound (Acts 8:4). Finally, (v) There are tremendous
possibilities in personal evangelism when pursued vigorously and scripturally. It
produces abundant results through the law of spiritual multiplication. For instance,
if a church of 100 dedicated and witnessing members will share the gospel with the
unsaved, each member with effective follow-up will, within a period of four months,
disciple a new convert till he becomes a soul winner. If each convert were in turn
to win one person to Christ, for example, spending four months helping him to grow
in faith, and then each of them in turn were to win another soul, there would be
in one year four hundred Christians. If they spend four months with the new converts
and if each of the four hundred believers wins another, they would be eight
hundreds. Continuing in that schedule, the membership of the church would be over
three million in five years. Precisely, if there were only one Christian in the world
and he worked a year, and won a friend to Christ, and if these two continued each
year to win another, and if every man they led into the kingdom of God continued
to win another, then, in thirty years, every person in the world would be won for
Christ.
</p>
<p>
To be involved in personal evangelism, personal experience of conversion is
indispensable (2 Timothy 2:6,7, 19-21; 2 Corinthians 5:17). Also, the soul-winner
must live a holy life (2 Timothy 2:4; Isaiah 52:11). Secondly, the true soul-winner
must have a strong, unshakable conviction (John 9:4; I Corinthians 9:16; Acts 26:22-
24; 21:8-14). He must, therefore, see himself as an ambassador of Christ (2
Corinthians 5:19,20) and must thus devote his time, talents, strength and money
to the furtherance of the Gospel. The world will never see Christ again until He comes
back in judgment, except as it sees Him in us. There should therefore be a strong
conviction about God, the Bible, salvation, Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection and His
second coming. Thirdly, the soul winner must accept that the responsibility of
preaching the gospel is not optional but a debt (Romans 1:14; Proverbs 24:11,12;
Ezekiel 33:6; I Corinthians 9:16). Furthermore, there is need for a deep, burning
Christ-like compassion (Matthew 9:36; Romans 9:1-3; 10:1). This should be the basis
for the sacrifices we make, effectual fervent prayers we offer, tears we shed and
hardship that we endure for the souls of men to be won to the Lord.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, there must be quite a lot of secret praying because there is no
substitute for expectant, secret waiting upon God for the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit, for wisdom, strength and power, and for courage, hope, faith and a glowing,
burning and appropriate message from God (2 Timothy 1:7). This prayer must be
importunate to open the hearts of men to God (Psalm 2:8). The soul-winner must be
skilful in the use of the Word which is the sword of the Spirit (Ephesians 6:17; 2
Timothy 2:15). He must also have a definite message, and recognize first that the
Gospel is a fact that must be told cheerfully; and an enthrusted fact, that should
be told faithfully. The soul-winner must preach the gospel with earnestness, love,
simplicity, tact and wisdom (1 Corinthians 9:20-23; 2 Timothy 2:24-26). He must not
give in to discouragement.
</p>
<p>
Opportunities for personal evangelism abound daily on the streets, hospitals,
motor parks, bus stops, inside the bus or taxi, prisons, homes of neighbours, schools,
markets, etc. The soul-winner does not wait for a perfect opportunity as every
situation is an opportunity (Ecclesiastes 11:4,6; 2 Timothy 4:2). An effective way of
conducting personal evangelism is through friendship. Friendship evangelism is the
art of leading a soul to Christ by cultivating his friendship. Deed of kindness, love,
service and friendliness can be the bait that will get a sinner interested in the gospel
message. The soul-winner must do things that will demonstrate that he cares for
the person&rsquo;s earthly welfare as well as his eternal soul. Friendship evangelism
reflects genuine and true Christlike love in action. Jesus Christ our Lord did not
count it ungodly to dine with sinners (Luke 19:5-7). Tracts, cassettes, good books,
magazines and even letter writing could be employed for personal evangelism. When
do we start personal evangelism? Now (John 4:35). This is because we cannot be
guiltless before God if we neglect it (Ezekiel 3:18,19). Millions of souls are rushing
towards a lost eternity. Believers must, therefore, throw aside all flimsy excuses
as there is no trouble too great, no humiliation too deep, no suffering too severe, no
labour too hard, no expense too much in saving souls. We must arise therefore, pray
and do the work."

       "Words" => "Marriage is a holy union, a living symbol, a precious relationship that needs tender
self-sacrificing care. It is God&rsquo;s idea and not a derivative of any culture. It is a gift from
God to man and it has three basic aspects: (i) The man leaves his parents, and in a public
act, pledges himself to his wife; (ii) The man and woman are joined together by taking
responsibility for each other&rsquo;s welfare and by loving the partner above all others; (iii) The
two become one flesh in the intimacy and commitment to the wonderful union which is
reserved for marriage. By so doing, marriage provides the needed fellowship, comfort,
companionship and partnership. It is one of God&rsquo;s methods to keep men and women free
from fornication and immorality. With very few exceptions, most men and women are to
marry. These few exceptions are to receive God&rsquo;s guidance and are not to be the product
of infantile decisions, misguided imitations, faithless consecration or frivolous religious
compassion (Genesis 2:18-20, 22-24; Matthew 19:4,5; Ephesians 5:31; I Corinthians
7:1,2,25-29,32).
</p>
<p>
Marriage is part of God&rsquo;s plan to raise the Christian family. But the believer is
not to go searching for a wife or husband, neither are they to resort to the abominable
method of &lsquo;sampling&rsquo; or &lsquo;picking and choosing&rsquo;. And the Lord God, said, <b>&ldquo;It is not good
that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him &rdquo;</b> (Genesis 2:18).
God seems to be saying, &ldquo; I am not going to allow the man to choose for himself&rdquo;. <b>&ldquo;And
the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman and brought
her unto him &rdquo;</b> (Genesis 2:22). God did not bring a girl, an immature female or a
teenager, but He brought a woman - (intelligible, sensible and mature) unto the man.
He brought a perfect fit - two of a kind! God still leads His children to His will in
marriage today. He does this through (i) His Word (Psalm 119:105,130; 2 Timothy
3:16,17), (ii) the inner voice of the Holy Spirit, prompting, directing, influencing or
checking (John 10:4,5,27; Romans 8:14; Proverbs 20:27; I Samuel 9:15-21; 16:12,13;
Joel 2:28,29; Acts 9:10-15). However, any revelation that is received must be
diligently compared with the Scripture. If any revelation, visions or dreams
contradict the Scripture in anyway, such revelations, visions or dreams are to be
rejected as false (Isaiah 8:19,20; Jeremiah 23:21-32; 2 Corinthians 11:13-15;
Revelation 22:18,19). Once the will of God is known, believers are to seek and obtain
their parents&rsquo; consent before going on with any further plans (Genesis 24:15-29;
34:3-12; Exodus 22:16; Deuteronomy 7:3; I Samuel 18:20,21; I Corinthians 7:36-38).
</p>
<p>
It is ungodly for any believer to elope with a woman or man no matter the divergent
and unyielding stance of their parents (Genesis 31:20-51). People in such a situation
must pray and trust in the Lord who gave the revelation of His will, to finish the work,
for <b>&ldquo; with God all things are possible &rdquo;</b> (Mark 10:27; Psalm 37:4; Philippians 4:6;
Proverbs 21:1). Thereafter, payment of bride price or dowry shall be executed in line
with the Scripture. It is an ungodly practice to borrow money or go into debt to impress
the woman&rsquo;s parents or invitees. It is also considered sinful for two people to live
together without meeting the requisite obligations to their parents (Exodus 22:17;
I Samuel 18:25-27; Hosea 3:2,3; 1 Corinthians 14:40; Romans 13:7,8). The parents&rsquo;
consent will lead, naturally, to a period of courtship to be determined by the church
leadership but preferably not longer than nine months. This affords the intending
couple the opportunity to understand each another and plan for the future together.
It is a time to be spent together not in secrecy but in the home of a Christian family
where movement of people is not restricted. It is during courtship that the intending
couple will discuss their expectations of each other (on finances, size of family
anticipated, extended family, etc). Purity must be maintained before, during and
after the courtship (I Thessalonians 4:3-7; 5:22). Visitations and exchange of gifts
at this stage are not acceptable, before the wedding. The Christian wedding is
preceded by &lsquo;filing in of notice&rsquo; at the Marriage Registry. This is to enable the public
inform the Magistrate should there be any objection to the proposed marriage. The
church wedding will take place after the Pastor had received a certificate from the
magistrate.
</p>
<p>
The church will not join a couple in marriage where (i) one of them had been
previously married and is separated from his or her partner (Matthew 19:4-6; John
4:18); (ii) the lady has not obtained the consent of her parents; (iii) the lady is already
pregnant (iv) the couple is in unequal yoke - one of them is not born again
(Deuteronomy 7:3; 2 Corinthians 6:14).
</p>
<p>
Therefore, no believer will marry an unbeliever or a divorced person. Moreover,
God&rsquo;s word forbids the believer marrying <b>&ldquo;any that is a near of kin&rdquo;</b>, that is <b>&ldquo;a
relative &rdquo;</b> (Leviticus 18:6). Marrying relatives was prohibited by God for physical,
social, and moral reasons. Children born to near relatives may experience serious
health problems. When improper sexual relations begin, family life is destroyed. <b>&ldquo;
For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you,
and the land is defiled ...&rdquo;</b> (Leviticus 18:27).
</p>
<p>
From the parables and actual marriages in the Scripture, weddings were
moments of rejoicing and feastings (Jeremiah 33:11; John 2:1-11; 3:29; Isaiah 62:5)
and special garments were provided for the bridegroom, bride, and guests at the
wedding (Matthew 22:12; Revelation 19:7,8). Yet, Christian practice must be guided
by the uniform teaching of Christian living in the New Testament (I Corinthians 7:29-
31; 6:12; 8:9,13; Romans 14:15; I John 2:6; 3:2-4). The believers therefore must shun
every form of worldliness and worldly imitations in dressing and in the manner of
entertaining guests. Simplicity and modesty must characterise the wedding in order
that God&rsquo;s name may be glorified.
</p>
<p>
The first step in creating a new union with one&rsquo;s spouse is the dissolving of the old
one: a severence of relationship with one&rsquo;s parents (Genesis 2:23,24; Ephesians
5:30,31). He is to &lsquo;leave father and mother&rsquo;, which means departing, loosing oneself,
finding freedom from them. Many who have violated this scriptural principle have
discovered to their chargrin a hurt to their marital joy. Marriage is &ldquo;until death do us
part&rdquo;, and God did not make any provisions for divorce or re-marriage.
</p>
<p>
In marriage, lack of spiritual, emotional, and intellectual intimacy usually precedes
a break down of physical intimacy. When couples fail to expose their secret thoughts to
one another, they shut off the line of communication to one another. The great secret
of conjugal happiness is mutual love, kindness, tenderness and loveliness of character
in the home. The wife should respect and obey the husband and the husband should love
and care for the wife (Ephesians 5:22-31). <b>&ldquo;Wives submit yourselves unto your own
husbands as unto the Lord ...&rdquo;</b> Submission is not the obliteration or nullification of the
woman&rsquo;s personality. It is neither subjugation nor an imposed obedience. Submission is
a voluntary subordination. It is obedience motivated by love (Philippians 2:5-8). <b>&ldquo;Likewise,
ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands ...&rdquo;</b> (I Peter 3:1-6). Such a life speaks
loudly and clearly, and is often the most effective way to influence a family member.
Christian wives should develop inner beauty rather than being overly concerned about
their appearance. When the wife lives the Christian faith quietly and consistently in the
home, her family would see Christ in her.
</p>
<p>
<b>&ldquo;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave
himself for it ... So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
loveth his wife, loveth himself &rdquo;</b> (Ephesians 5:25,28). Christ is the model of love. The
husband can never love his wife too much; yet, that love is inconsequential when
compared to his love for the Lord. The husband&rsquo;s love makes him to be considerate,
understanding and is able to bear with his wife.
</p>
<p>
The husband is also the head of the family. This headship has the idea of
authority, an authority after the analogy of Christ&rsquo;s headship. In that sense, the
husband is the spiritual head of the family and his wife goes along with his
leadership. A wise and Christ-honouring husband will not take advantage of his role,
and a wise and Christ-honouring wife will not try to undermine her husband&rsquo;s
leadership.
</p>
<p>
<b>&ldquo;Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as
himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband &rdquo;</b> (Ephesians 5:33)."

up in the air to go and prepare a place for His own. The parting promise from God
was that Jesus will return in like manner to receive His &lsquo;Bride&rsquo; to be with Him forever
(Acts 1:9-11; John 14:1-3).
</p>
<p>
The rapture is not the same as the Second Coming of Christ. At the Rapture,
Christ will appear in the air. He will not be visible to the inhabitants of the earth.
His mission then will be to resurrect all dead saints, who, along with the living
believers, will put on immortality and shall be caught up to be with the Lord. This
event will take place in the twinkling of an &lsquo;eye&rsquo; before the great and terrible day
of the Lord, when the wrath of God will be poured down from His cup of indignation
without mixture - an event fitly called the Great Tribulation (I Corinthians 15:52).
The Second Advent will not take place until after the great tribulation. The time of
the Rapture is unknown, even by the angels (Matthew 24:36; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-
5). The Rapture will be heralded by the voice of the archangel and the blowing of
trumpets signalling the end of the Church age (I Thessalonians 4:13-15).
</p>
<p>
The Rapture was a mystery, unknown to the Old Testament saints and prophets.
God had underlined this great event in two different ways in the Scripture to assure
us of its certainty. First, it was illustrated in Enoch and Elijah, the two living saints
who did not taste death but were translated in a moment of time and caught up in
the air (Genesis 5:24, 2 Kings 2:11,12).
</p>
<p>
Second, it was illustrated in Christ in the New Testament. He died, was buried
and resurrected. While He talked with His disciples on Mount Olivet, He was taken
up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight (Acts 1:9-11).
</p>
<p>
The rapture which was a mystery to the Old Testament prophets marks the end
of the Church Age, also referred to as the time of the Gentiles (Luke 21:24). This
truth was veiled to the saints of old. However, known unto God are all His works
from the foundation of the earth. In His mercy, He interrupted His programme for
Israel with the interpolation of Church Age. Christ the Messiah came for His people
but they rejected Him (John 1:11), and God turned to the Gentiles to take a people
for Himself. The rapture will mark the end of this special period of grace. Does
this mean that God has forsaken His people Israel forever? Far from it, God will
resume His programme with Israel immediately after the rapture, thus ushering
in the beginning of the Seventieth week in Daniel&rsquo;s prophecy (Daniel 9:24-27).
</p>
<p>
Any moment from now, the trumpet shall sound and He that shall come will come
and will not tarry. It is very certain that Christ is coming back again. He assured
the Church of the certainty of His coming (John 14:1-3). Angels proclaimed it,
apostles and saints throughout the ages preached it. All the signs of His coming are
daily being fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
Christ, answering a pertinent question asked by His disciples on <b>&ldquo;...What shall
be the sign of thy coming...&rdquo;</b> (Matthew 24:3), gave in details what would be
happening on earth shortly before His coming (Matthew 24:5-12,30-39). He
highlighted the following as what to expect:<br/>
(i)&nbsp; Many false Christ&rsquo;s will arise to deceive many unsuspecting believers.<br/>
(ii)&nbsp; There will be wars and rumours of war.<br/>
(iii)&nbsp; There will be international wars.<br/>
(iv)&nbsp; Famines (global economic recession)<br/>
(v)&nbsp; Pestilences<br/>
(vi)&nbsp; Earthquakes in divers places<br/>
(vii)&nbsp; There will be persecution of Christ&rsquo;s followers and some cases of martyrdom.<br/>
(viii)&nbsp; The emergence of many false prophets.<br/>
(ix)&nbsp; Backsliding from the faith on the increase<br/>
(x)&nbsp; More people given to pleasure and merry-making than those seeking the Lord.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The scripture also predicts the conditions, characterized by a system of denials,
that will be prevalent within the visible Church, shortly before Christ&rsquo;s return. There
will be a denial of God (2 Timothy 3:1-5), a denial of Christ (I John 2:18; 4:3), a denial
of Christ&rsquo;s return (2 Peter 3:3,4), a denial of the faith of Christian living (Jude 18)
and a denial of authority. All these signs are being fulfilled before our very eyes.
</p>
<p>
To qualify to partake in the rapture, one must be born again, live a transparent
holy life, walk daily in the light, do service for God, watch daily, pray always with
all prayer, and maintain these experiences at the time of the Rapture or at the time
of death as the case may be (John 3:3; Hebrews 12:14; John 4:35-38; 9:1-4; I
Thessalonians 4:16,17).
</p>
<p>
All the signs preceding the Second Advent of Christ are all fulfilled, a clear
indication that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ is very close and the time of the
Rapture is much closer. Sinning Church members will not be able to go at the
rapture, though saved before and baptised in water. Careless and compromising
preachers will miss the rapture; it does not matter what Christian work they may
have done in the past. All such people together with backsliders and sinners outside
the Church will be left behind to face the Great Tribulation.
</p>
<p>
Knowing that these things shall be, that the rapture will occur unannounced,
and it is very imminent, what manner of persons ought believers to be. Sinners are
to make haste to repent and embrace Christ, as their Saviour. The Saints of God
are to watch and pray lest that day comes upon them unprepared (Matthew 24:42-44)."

$doctrines[] = array("Title" => "The Resurrection of The Dead",
       "Heading" =>  "That the Resurrection of the dead is taught in the Bible as clearly as the immortality of the soul. Every individual who has ever lived will be resurrected, some to honour and glory and others to everlasting shame
       and contempt",
      "Citation" => "Job 19:25-27; Psalm 71:20; Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2; John
5:28,29; I Corinthians 15:12-57; I Thessalonians 4:13-16; Hebrews 6:1,2;
Philippians 3:8-11; Revelation 20:4,6,12,13.",
       "Words" => "The resurrection of the dead is a cardinal and an important doctrine of the Bible.
As a fact, all who die in this world will undergo physical resurrection before the Great
White Throne Judgement. This doctrine shows that there will be a resurrection of
the body, joined with the soul to meet the LORD either in peace and joy, or meet
Him (as a Judge) in condemnation, eternal punishment and torment of hell fire.
</p>
<p>
Jesus, the Prophet come from God, declared in John 5:25, <b>&ldquo;Verily, verily, I say
unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of
the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.&rdquo;</b> The fact of the resurrection of the
just and unjust rings through the teaching of Jesus Christ (John 6:40; 11:25;
Matthew 16:21; 22:23-32). Job spoke of his eyes and flesh seeing God after worms
have destroyed his body (Job 19:25-27). Isaiah spoke of the earth casting out the dead
(Isaiah 26:14,19). Daniel spoke of the awakening of many that sleep in the dust, some
to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt (Daniel 12:2). In
like manner spoke David (Psalms 16:10; 17:15), Old Testament saints (Hebrews
11:35), New Testament saints (Matthew 28:1-20; Mark 16:1-18; Luke 24:1-49; John
20: 19-21) including Paul (Acts 17:18,32), Peter (I Peter 1:3; 3:21), even Herod the
wicked King and the generality of the people of his day believed in the resurrection
of the dead (Mark 6:14-16).
</p>
<p>
The form to be associated with the resurrected body of the just is exemplified by
the glorified body that Jesus, the first fruit, had after His resurrection (Luke 24:36-
43; John 20:11-20,24-31; I John 3:2). All resurrected bodies will be immortal (Daniel
12:2; Mark 9:42-48). The resurrected bodies of saints will possess different degrees
of glory. <b>&ldquo;There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another
glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the
resurrection of the dead &rdquo;</b>
(I Corinthians 15:39-54).
</p>
<p>
In the intervening period between death (when the body and soul are separated)
and the resurrection, one may ask: Where is the soul? The soul of a saint of God goes
immediately to meet God in heaven. The repentant malefactor on the cross received
forgiveness and assurance of Jesus: <b>&ldquo;Today shall thou be with me in paradise &rdquo;</b>
(Luke 23:39-43). Righteous Lazarus died and was <b>&ldquo;carried by angels into Abraham&rsquo;s
bosom &rdquo;</b> where he was comforted (Luke 16:19-31). Stephen at death said, <b>&ldquo;I see the
heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God &rdquo;</b> ready
to receive him (Acts 7:54-60). Paul was <b>&ldquo;willing rather to be absent from the body
and to be present with the Lord &rdquo;</b> (2 Corinthians 5:1-8). Many other references of
the Scripture confirm that the soul of the saint rejoices in God&rsquo;s presence at death
(Philippians 1:21-23; Ecclesiastes 12:1,7). On the other hand, when a sinner dies,
his soul goes immediately to hell. In hell fire, he is conscious; he can see, feel and
hear (Luke 16:19-31).
</p>
<p>
The timing for the resurrection to life of the just and resurrection to judgement
of the unjust is well spelt out in the scriptures in accordance with the ordained
programme of God.
</p>
<p>
The resurrection of the saints of God also variously described in scriptures as
resurrection of life (John 5:28,29), resurrection of the just (Luke 14:13,14), a better
resurrection (Hebrews 11:35) and the first resurrection (Revelation 20:4-6), has four
phases:<br/>
(i)&nbsp;  The resurrection of Christ, the first fruit (I Corinthians 15:3,4,12,20,23).<br/>
(ii)&nbsp;  The resurrection of the Church-age saints at the rapture (I Thessalonians
4:13-16).<br/>
(iii)&nbsp;  The resurrection of the tribulation period saints (Revelation 20:3-5).<br/>
(iv)&nbsp;  The resurrection of Old Testament saints at the second advent of Christ to
the earth (Daniel 12:2; Isaiah 26:19).<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the saints of God that ever died would resurrect in the first resurrection. Not
a soul will be left behind. What joy! What triumph!! <b>&ldquo;Blessed and holy is he that
hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but
they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand
years&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 20:6).
</p>
<p>
The second resurrection is still part of God&rsquo;s programme but deals with the
unsaved dead. There is a difference in time of one thousand years between the first
and second resurrection (Revelation 20:5-15). The second resurrection is also
described as the resurrection to damnation (John 5:29). There will be everlasting
punishment and torment in the lake of fire for all who partake in the second
resurrection who have missed the first resurrection and whose names are not found
in the Book of Life (Daniel 12:2; Revelation 20:11-15).
</p>
<p>
As in the early church when Hymenaeus and Philetus erred concerning the truth
by teaching that the resurrection was past already, thereby making a shipwreck of
their faith and that of all those who followed their false doctrine, there are many
false teachers today who <b>&ldquo;know not the scriptures nor the power of God&rdquo;</b> and
overthrow the faith of many (2 Timothy 2:17,18; Matthew 22:23-32). Today many false
teachings on the resurrection of the dead abound having the same devastating
effects on all who believe them. Among such doctrines are (a) Annihilation and (b)
Purgatory.
</p>
<p>
The doubt, unbelief and scoffing of sinners will not prevent the complete
resurrection programme of God for both the saved and the unsaved, the same way
it did not alter the resurrection from the dead of our Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ
(Acts 23:8; 2 Timothy 2:15-18; I Corinthians 15:12-23; Romans 3:3,4). The resurrection
of Christ and the future resurrection of the saints form the foundation of our
Christian faith (I Corinthians 15:16-20). <b>&ldquo;For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ
raised; and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then
they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have
hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. BUT NOW IS CHRIST RISEN
FROM THE DEAD!&rdquo;</b>
</p>
<p>
To partake in the first resurrection, the resurrection of the saved, there must
of necessity first be a spiritual resurrection in the present life, whereby the spirit
is quickened from death in trespasses and sins, and the whole being renewed in the
glorious likeness of God to a life of righteousness and holiness without which no man
shall see the Lord ( Ephesians 2:1,2,4-6; 1Thessalonians 4:14,16; 2 Corinthians 5:17-
19; Hebrews 12:14)."

or organization but a person - a supernatural, diabolical being, in the
form of a man who will blaspheme and proclaim himself to be God. The Marriage

	"Words" => "The Great Tribulation is described as the <b>&ldquo; ... time of Jacob&rsquo;s trouble&rdquo; (Jeremiah
30:7) &rdquo;;</b>... great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this
time, no, nor ever shall be&rdquo;</b> (Matthew 24:21). <b>&ldquo; ... the day of the Lord&rdquo;</b> (Joel 1:15).
<b>&ldquo; ... a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness&rdquo;</b>,
(Joel 2: 2). <b>&ldquo; ... a day of wasteness and desolation&rdquo;</b> (Zephaniah 1:14,15). <b>&ldquo;... a time
of trouble&rdquo;</b> (Daniel 12:1). The purpose of the great tribulation is to make Israel suffer
so that they can be ready to cry to the Messiah (the Lord Jesus Christ whom they, at
present, reject) to come back to them. It is also to judge the unbelieving men and
women of all ages (Zechariah 12:10,11; 13:1-9; 14:12-13).
</p>
<p>
The Bible shows that the great tribulation will take off after the rapture of the
church (I Thessalonians 4:13-18; Revelation 4:1) and will last for seven years. It will
end at the second Advent of Jesus Christ when He alights on Mount Olives
(Zechariah 14:4; Matthew 25:31; Revelation 19:11,12; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; Jude
14,15; Acts 1:11) and settles on earth (Jerusalem) for a thousand-year reign called
the Millennial Reign (Revelation 20:4,5). This means that it is post-rapture and pre-
millenium or, the 70th of Daniel&rsquo;s 70 weeks (i.e after the 69th week) Daniel 9:26,27;
Revelation 19:11-19,21; Matthew 24:15-31; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-8). It is post-rapture
because God will not like His children to suffer the great tribulation, its judgements
and destructions. He saved Noah ( a preacher of righteousness) and his family before
destroying the world with flood (Genesis 6:8-10; Genesis 7:1-13,16-24; 8:15-22). He
rescued Lot (who was vexed with the filthy conversation of Sodom) and his family
before destroying it with fire (Genesis 19:10-29). So God will take away His children
from the earth before the great tribulation begins. The great tribulation reaches its
peak of destructions, judgements, terrors, frightening wars and desolation from the
middle of the seven-year duration and ends with Christ&rsquo;s second advent. This is
when the anti-Christ breaks his seven-year peace covenant with Israel and attacks
Jerusalem (Revelation 19:15-19,21; Matthew 24:15-22; Daniel 12:1; Jeremiah 30:6-9).
</p>
<p>
The great tribulation is described as being full of woes, judgements, famines,
bloody wars, explosions, plagues (incurable epidemics which become pandemic),
terror, anguish and earthquakes. It will be a time men will be calling unto the
mountain to fall upon them; burning rocks falling from heaven upon the earth and
scorching it, seas will be polluted, cattles and vegetations will be destroyed and
millions will be dying from catastrophes, <b>&ldquo;as if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear
met him ... leaned his hand on the wall, and serpent bit him&rdquo;</b>. Beasts and men
will be in trouble even mighty men will weep. <b>&ldquo;Neither their gold and silver (riches)
will be able to deliver them&rdquo;</b>. Whole cities and nations will be under great distress,
perplexity, as the seas and waves roaring, hypertension and confusion as the powers
of the heavens will be shaken by God (Amos 5:18,19; Isaiah 2:19; 24:1-3,6,19; Mark
13:24; Joel 1:15; Luke 21:25,26; Matthew 24:11-26; Revelation 19:1-3,11-19,21). The
great tribulation opens with the rapture of the church (I Thessalonians 4:13-18;
Revelation 14:1) then the rise of the Anti-Christ (2 Thessalonians 1:7,8). He wins
nations, some by war while others concede authority to him (Daniel 7:8,24-25;
Revelation 17:8-14). The False Prophet popularizes him, making men to worship even
his image. No one buys or sells without the mark or number (666) of the beast. While
these are going on, saints receive rewards in heaven (Revelation 2:17,25-28; 3:12).
There will be great apostasy, more of false religions and increase in the power of the
devil who will be driven down to the earth (2 Thessalonians 2:3-12; Revelation 12:10-
12; 13:2,12-18). God&rsquo;s planned judgements will fall on men in a divine sequence,
producing supernatural phenomena and demonic creatures unknown to man. These
will come as Christ opens seven seals of a scroll on which they occur, then the blowing
of seven trumpets each, a harbinger of more woes. 144,000 Jews will be sealed and
raptured as well as countless tribulation saints from all over the world (Revelation 7:1-
17). Saints in tribulation will be martyred (Revelation 6:9-11; 14:13; 20:4-6). A mighty
Angel appears with rainbow on his head, a little book opened and swears that &ldquo;there
should be time no longer&rdquo;, (Revelation 10:1-11). After this, the high point of
catastrophies called &ldquo;the great tribulation&rdquo; begins for the remaining 31/2 years
(Revelation 11:1-19; Daniel 12:1,5-7; Jeremiah 30:6,7). Jerusalem falls to the Anti-
Christ and Israel is defeated (Matthew 24:15-22; Daniel 11:40-45). Israel runs for refuge
in old Edom (Revelation 12:6,13-17; Isaiah 16:1-5). There will be more woes on earth
through the pouring out on it of the content of seven vials (Revelation 15:1-6; 16:21; 18:1-
24). God&rsquo;s two witnesses appear, are killed and later resurrect (Revelation 11:7-12).
The marriage supper of the Lamb takes place (Revelation 19:1-10) and saints prepare
to return to the earth with Christ (Jude 14,15; Revelation 19:11).
</p>
<p>
The scope will cover Israel, the middle east and the whole earth. The powers at work
will be (a) the Anti-Christ called the Beast, the King of the north, the Syrian, the Assyrian,
the king of Babylon, the Extortioner, the man of sin, the little horn, the Prince that shall
come, a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark saying, the spoiler, the son
of perdition and that wicked one empowered personally by Satan (2 Thessalonian 2:1-
10; Daniel 7:8,24; 8:9,23; 9:26,27,36-45; Revelation 13:1-18; 14:9-11; Isaiah 10:31; 30:31;
Micah 5:3-15; Isaiah 14:4; 16:4; Daniel 7:11). (b) The false Prophet (Revelation 13:1-19;
14:9-11; 15:2-4; 16:2-12; 19:20; Daniel 9:27; 11:35, 45; 12:7; Matthew 24:15). (c) God&rsquo;s
powerful judgements (Joel 1:15; 2:11; Amos 5:18; Revelation 4-19:1-21). (d) The devil
(Revelation 12:7-17; 20:1-2; 2 Thessalonian 2:9).
</p>
<p>
While terrors are unleashed on the earth, saints will be (a) receiving rewards:
crowns, mansions, new names, white stones, etc, at the judgement seat of Christ
(Bema) (I Corinthians 3:11-15; Luke 14:14; I Corinthians 9:24-27; 2 Corinthians 5:10;
Romans 14:10-12; Matthew 16:27; John 14:1,2; 1Thessalonians 2:19; James 1:12;
2 Timothy 4:8; Revelation 2:17,25-28; 3:12,21; 22:12-16). The believers&rsquo; time of
judgement and reward only means the evaluation of believers&rsquo; works for which they
may receive rewards or loss of reward. All raptured believers will be eternally saved.
(b) Rejoicing and feasting at the marriage supper in heaven (Revelation 19:6-9) (c)
Worshipping God with the angels (Revelation 7:9-17; 14:1-5; 4:5,7) and (d) preparing
for the second Advent with Christ upon white horses (Jude 14,15; Revelation 19:11-
14; Matthew 25:31).
</p>
<p>
The great tribulation ends when Jerusalem is ravished by the Anti-Christ with two
thirds of it captured at the end of the seventh year, and the children of Israel will repent
in great mourning and tears, calling for the Messiah, Jesus Christ to come back to the
earth and establish the millennial reign all over humanity (Zechariah 14:4-8; Micah
1:3,4; Zechariah 14:1-3; 13:1; 12:4-14; Zephaniah 3:8; Joel 3:13-16). All Israel will be
saved (Romans 11:25-27; Hebrews 8:8-12; 10:17; Zechariah 12:10; 13:1; Isaiah 66:7,8).
Jesus then descends, destroys the anti-Christ, the false prophet and casts them into
the lake of fire together with his armies at the battle of Armageddon (valley of Megido),
then an angel, binds the devil and casts him into the bottomless pit for 1000 years
(Revelation 19:20; Ezekiel 38:3,9; Revelation 20:1-3; Zechariah 14; Revelation 1-20; Revelation 19:11-21; Isaiah 34; Jude 14,15). Jesus Christ then builds a millennial temple at Jerusalem from where He rules the whole world."

	"Words" => "The Scriptures abound with evidence that speaks of the certainty of Christ&rsquo;s
Second Coming. Our Lord Jesus spoke of His return several times, once leading the
disciples to enquire about the signs that would herald that certain event. A study
of the scriptures indicates that certain prophecies concerning Christ, and some
future programme of God are not yet fulfilled and would only be, after the second
advent of Christ. However, all the signs preceding the second advent are being
fulfilled daily. Going through the Olivet discourse of Matthew 24 and 25, the following
signs of His coming are clear. Jesus Himself said, there would be deceptions
(Matthew 24:4-5,11,24), false christs (Matthew 24:5,23-26), wars and rumours of
wars (Matthew 24:6-7), Famines (Matthew 24:7), pestilences, earthquakes, anti-
semitism (Matthew 24:9; Mark 13:9,13), offences (Matthew 24:10), betrayals,
hatred, false prophets (Matthew 24:11), lawlessness and martyrdom. He said the
impact of the second coming will be as universal as when <b>&ldquo;the lightning cometh out
of the east and shineth unto the west ...&rdquo;</b> It would make all <b>&ldquo;the tribes of the earth
to mourn&rdquo;</b>. They would be deep in spiritual lethargy and indifference as was the case
in the time of Noah&rsquo;s flood (Matthew 24:27,30,37).
</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit, through the apostles, confirmed that Christ shall appear <b>&ldquo;the
second time&rdquo;</b> (Hebrews 9:28) and would then reward His faithful servants with
crowns of glory, praise and honour and His adversaries with fiery indignation (I Peter
5:4; 1:7; Hebrews 10:27). James the apostle also encouraged believers: <b>&ldquo;Be ye also
patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth near&rdquo;</b>. The angel
of God confirmed that, <b>&ldquo;this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven&rdquo;</b> (Acts 1:11).
</p>
<p>
The prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 that the government (of the whole world) would be on
His (Christ&rsquo;s) shoulders is yet to be fulfilled. Also, some prophecies in Isaiah 61
concerning our Lord Jesus Christ were only partially fulfilled at His first coming.
Christ Himself confirmed in Luke 4:21 that <b>&ldquo;this day is this scripture fulfilled in
your ears&rdquo;</b>. The rest of the prophecies in that chapter would be fulfilled after His
second advent.
</p>
<p>
The exactitude with which the old time prophecies concerning the first coming
of Christ were fulfilled points to the infallibility of the Scriptures and to the certainty
of those prophecies concerning His second advent. Prophecies on His virgin birth,
details of His earthly life, His death, burial and resurrection were all literally
fulfilled to the letter, and so would those relating to His second coming.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the fulfilment of the prophecies concerning Christ, other divine purposes
which the second advent would fulfil include: (i) the comfort of the church (John 14:1-
3; 16:20-22); (ii) the restoration of Israel to her sovereignty as prophesied in the scripture
(Isaiah 32:18; 33:20-24); (iii) the judgement of the earth (Revelation 20:11-15; John
5:22); (iv) The renovation of the earth (Isaiah 67:17; 66:22; Revelation 21:1); (v) The
restoration of all things as God wants it (Romans 8:20-23; Jeremiah 12:4,11).
</p>
<p>
The greatest event that will precede the Second Coming of Christ is the Rapture
- the catching up of the saints to meet the Lord in the air and to be with him forever.
The Rapture lies in the valley between the mountains of Christ&rsquo;s first and second
coming. It is a part of the mystery of the church which in the Old Testament age <b>&ldquo;was
not made known unto the sons of men&rdquo;</b> as it was revealed in the New Testament
to &ldquo;His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit &rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
The Rapture should, however, not be confused with the Second Coming. The two
events are distinct and separated by seven years. Specifically, the second coming
refers to Christ&rsquo;s coming to the earth to live as He did in the first coming, to be seen
by every eye. In the rapture, Christ would not come to the earth but stop in the air
where the saints will meet him. It is not every eye that will see Christ at the rapture.
When Christ meets the saints in the air, He will take them to heaven where they
would remain, out of the period of the Great Tribulation (Revelation 19:18,19). It is
during this seven-year period that the marriage supper of the Lamb and the
judgement of saints for reward would take place in heaven (1 Corinthians 3:12-15;
2 Corinthians 5:10). In other words, the rapture is the time Christ comes for the
saints, to take them to heaven. In the second coming, however, He will come to the
earth to live and fulfil a definite part of God&rsquo;s time-table for the earth and man. Christ
would come with the saints raptured seven years earlier. Whereas the rapture can
take place any moment without warning; the second coming cannot happen until
after both the rapture and the Great Tribulation.
</p>
<p>
In His Second Coming, Christ will reign on the earth for one thousand years with
the saints. Christened the Millennial Reign, Christ&rsquo;s rule would be characterized
by unprecedented peace, prosperity and blessings on the earth (Isaiah 11:1-9).
Satan, the author of heartache, strife and contention would be bound for the duration
of Christ&rsquo;s Millennial Reign (Revelation 20:2,3).
</p>
<p>
Satan and his cohorts will mobilise forces to fight Christ and to frustrate His
coming again to establish the Millennial Reign, just in the same way he used Herod
in his attempt to kill Christ at His first coming. He was defeated and again he will
be defeated. The battle against Christ and His host is called the Battle of Armageddon
(Revelation 19:11-21; 20:1-4). There will be a great and terrible slaughter of the
armies of the anti-christ gathered from the nations of the earth through the efforts
of the evil spirits sent out over the earth by Satan, the anti-christ and the false
prophet (Revelation 17:13,14). This Satan&rsquo;s last attempt to wrongfully take the
Kingdom from Christ will fail.
</p>
<p>
The world and the church are called to prepare for this great event. The world
is admonished to repent and come to Christ before the day of the Lord (John 3:1-
8). The Church as a bride is called to be ready, holy, spotless, watchful, prayerful and busy preaching His word until He comes (Hebrews 12:14; 1 John 3:1-3; 2 Timothy 4:1,2; Ephesians 5:25-27). <b>&ldquo;Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 1:7)."

	"Words" => "The word millennium, is a compound derivative from Latin which simply
translates into a thousand years. Thus, Christ&rsquo;s millennial reign is a thousand
years of the full manifestation of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is sequel
to the Great Tribulation period which is a period of intense suffering for everyone
on earth.
</p>
<p>
According to God&rsquo;s revealed time-table, the Church will suddenly be taken
away by Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18) in a mysterious event known as &ldquo;the
Rapture&rdquo;. Then, a seven-year period of great suffering for sinners left behind will
follow (Matthew 24:21,22). At the end of the seven-year period, Jesus will come
again with the church to establish His government (Jude 14). The government
of this world, at that time, will resist His coming. But the Lord will overcome at
the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 19:15-21). Satan will be bound and
imprisoned for 1000 years (Revelation 20:1-3). The kingdom of this world will,
then, become the kingdom of our God and His Christ (Revelation 11:15).
</p>
<p>
Christ&rsquo;s millennial reign will be a time when the purposes of God will be fully
realised on earth, as theocracy (government of the state under the firm control
and direction of God) will be established. Christ, as the divine representative of
God will at this time, speak and act for God. He will be given a universal and
glorious dominion with absolute power to govern (Isaiah 9:6; Psalm 45:4; Isaiah
11:4; Psalm 72:4). It will be the responsibility of Christ at this age to announce
God&rsquo;s will and law (Isaiah 2:3,4; 33:21,22: 42:4; Acts 3:22).
</p>
<p>
Christ&rsquo;s millennial reign will be a manifestation of the promise God gave
David, that his throne shall have no end. Christ, as David&rsquo;s &ldquo;son&rdquo;, will thus
establish a glorious house and throne, over an equally glorious kindgom (2
Samuel 7:12-16; Psalm 72; Isaiah 11:10). Divine mercy, goodness and truth will
be displayed through Christ even as the glory associated with His deity,
omniscience, omnipotence and righeousness will be fully made manifest. The
Gentile world system (humanity without Christ) as it is at present, organised
under the direct influence of Satan, will thus become an out-moded set-up.
</p>
<p>
In its stead comes Christ&rsquo;s millennial reign, void of sin and all forms of
unrighteousness. Satan, having been defeated and bound, will lack the power
to induce people to sin (Revelation 20:1-6; Matthew 19:28; Ephesians 5:25-27).
</p>
<p>
What are the components of the millennium? (1) The millennium shall
witness an unprecedented era of national and individual peace. There will be a
complete cessation of the scourge of wars, as the kingdoms of the world will be
fused together under the reign of Christ. The ensuing peace will herald an era
of economic boom and prosperity. The beauty of this age is that hitherto
antagonistic and irreconciliable foes will henceforth co-habit as &ldquo;sheep and
lambs&rdquo;. (2) There will be joy unspeakable (Isaiah 9:3,4; Jeremiah 30:18,19). (3)
There will be holiness (Ezekiel 43:7-12; Isaiah 1:26,27). (4) Glory (Isaiah
24:23,60:1-9). (5) Comfort (Isaiah 12:1-2; Jeremiah 33:23-25). (6) Justice (Isaiah
9:7; 11:5; 42:1-4). (7) Full knowledge (Isaiah 11:1-2,9; 41:19-20; 54:13; Habakkuk
2:14).
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the following benefits will also accrue to the inhabitants of the
age (a) The original curse placed upon mankind at creation will be removed,
resulting in abundant productivity of the earth (Isaiah 11:6-9; 35:9; 65:25. (b)
Sickness will become a thing of the past (Isaiah 33:24; Jeremiah 30:17; Ezekiel
34:16). (c) Healing will be naturally available to the deformed (Isaiah 29:17-19).
</p>
<p>
Against the background of the above, there shall be (a) preservation of life
(Isaiah 41:8-14; 62:8,9; Jeremiah 32:27; Ezekiel 34:27; Joel 3:16,17; Amos 9:15;
Zechariah 14:10,11) and (b) complete freedom from all forms of oppression that
at present ravage mankind (Isaiah 14:3-6; 42:6,7; 49:8,9; Zechariah 9:11,12).
</p>
<p>
Who are those expected to partake in Christ&rsquo;s millennial reign? (i) The
Glorious Church (Ephesians 5:25-27). This will exclude the apostate church that
is married to the world (Revelation 17:1-7). (ii) The poor in spirit (Matthew 5:3).
These are those who recognise and admit their state of spiritual poverty (life on
earth without assurance of salvation) and are willing to turn away from sin and
surrender to Christ, (iii) The watchful, prayerful (Hebrews 9:28; Matthew 25:34)."

a time to come when all wicked/ungodly people (the living and the dead, small and great
who have neglected God&rsquo;s salvation) will face the final judgement of the Living God
(Romans 14:12). We caution that the teaching must not be approached with doubtful
disputations or viewed as fable or fiction but a fact. These are true sayings of God written
for our learning and admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come (Romans
15:4; I Corinthians 10:11; Revelation 19:9).
</p>
<p>
The Bible (Gods revelation to man) clearly presents the order of events preceding
the Great White Throne Judgement and constantly enjoins <b>&ldquo;He that hath an ear,
let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 2:7). At the close
of the millennium, the devil will be released from <b>&ldquo;the bottomless pit&rdquo;</b> (Revelation
20:3) and he will deceive thousands of people and will gather them to fight against
the King (Jesus Christ) and His Saints. This will be the battle of Gog and Magog; but
at the end of the battle, when the rebellious have been killed, and destroyed by the
fire of His indignation which comes down from heaven, the devil will be cast into the
lake of fire (Revelation 20:7-10). After this, the Great White Throne Judgement will
be set. God will sit on a throne so white, magnificent and terrible at sight that the
whole face of the earth and heaven (the atmospheric heaven) will tremble and flee
from Him. All those who died unrepentant from the time of Adam till the time of the
Great White Throne Judgement will be resurrected (Daniel 12:2; John 5:28-29; Acts
24:15). This is called the second resurrection. And they will all stand before God to
account for their deeds. This final judgement of sinners (the living and the dead,
small and great) is known as the Great White Throne Judgement (Psalm 9:17; Daniel
7:9-10; Matthew 11:20-24; 10:15; John 5:28-29; Revelation 20:11-15). The Bible is
replete with pointers to this great and notable day of the Lord (Ecclesiastes 12:14;
Matthew 11:21-24; 12:41,42; Romans 2:15,16; 2 Peter 2:9; Jude 14,15).
</p>
<p>
The world is corrupt and polluted. Man is rebellious and disobedient against God.
For a long time it has repented the Lord that He has made man on the earth, for
every imagination of the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart has been evil continually (Genesis
6:5-6). Will man continue in his wilful disobedience and rebellion against God? No,
for <b>&ldquo;...He hath appointed A DAY, in which He will judge the world in righteousness
...&rdquo;</b> (Acts 17:30,31). No true believer whose name is written in the Book of Life will
face the Great White Throne Judgement since their judgement as sinners was
accomplished by Christ on the cross (John 3:17-19,30; Romans 8:1; John 5:20,24).
Besides, <b>&ldquo;...God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord
Jesus Christ&rdquo;</b> (I Thessalonians 5:9). <b>&ldquo;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and
abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters,
and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone: which is the second death&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 21:8). That great congregation
will consist of: (i) All categories of sinners (dead and alive) from Adam to date. They
will be judged for neglecting the salvation of God (Hebrews 2:3). (ii) All backsliders
in all dispensations who denied the faith of Him that once bought them (Exodus
32:33). (iii) All who deny the deity of Jesus Christ (John 3:18,36). These are the
skeptics, the atheists, the idol worshippers and all religious hypocrites (Matthew
23:27).
</p>
<p>
At the Great White Throne Judgment, Death, the age-long enemy of God&rsquo;s
creation and Satan&rsquo;s principal messenger of destruction and instrument of cruelty
will be stripped of his power, and together with hell, will be cast into the lake of fire
(Revelation 20:14;
1 Corinthians 15:26). The old heaven and earth
which had been polluted with sin, defiled by Satan, demons and sinners, shall be
burnt up (2 Peter 3:7,10-12).
</p>
<p>
In righteousness He will judge: (a) All unrighteous deeds of men (I John 5:17; Romans
11:28-32). Every unrighteous act, feeling or imagination that was not cleansed by the blood
of the Lamb will be condemned at the Great White Throne Judgment. (b) The secret deeds
of men (Matthew 10:26; Romans 2:16; Hebrews 4:13; 2 Chronicle 16:9). Every secret bribery,
immorality, pornography, drunkenness, abortion, etc, will be revealed. <b>&ldquo;....Books (books
of records) were opened...and the dead were judged out of those things which were
written in the books, according to their works&rdquo;</b> Revelation 20:10. There is a record in
heaven for everything done under the sun <b>&ldquo;...whether it be good or bad&rdquo;</b> (2 Corinthians
5:10b). (c) The words of men (Matthew 12:36,37; 5:22; Ephesians 4:29,31; 5:4). <b>&ldquo;Every
idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment&rdquo;</b>.
Every gossip, backbiting and slander against our neighbours, fellow believers or church
leaders will be judged. All foolish unedifying words, corrupt, graceless words, defamatory
and abusive words against others will be accounted for at the Great White Throne Judgment.
<b>&ldquo;For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned&rdquo;</b>
(Matthew 12:37). God will judge every unrepentant sinner or backslider according to His
divine will and righteousness (Proverbs 11:21). God&rsquo;s judgement will be fair, without
partiality or respect of persons (Romans 2:2-12; Job 34:18-22). He will judge the small and
the great, the rich and the poor, the educated and the illiterate, the highly respected and
the most despised. <b>&ldquo;For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God,
a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh rewards [bribe]&rdquo;</b>
(Deuteronomy 10:17). The righteous Judge of the universe will receive no bribe to pervert
judgement on the great day of His wrath. But <b>&ldquo;... in righteousness he doth judge and make
war&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 19:11). Without partiality <b>&ldquo;WHOSOEVER was NOT found WRITTEN in
the BOOK OF LIFE was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 20:15)."

	"Words" => "The present age in which we live is referred to in scriptures as the &ldquo;last days&rdquo;
(Hebrews 1:1,2). This age is very significant in the plan of God as it ushers us into
another important series of events often called in theology as &ldquo;eschatology&rdquo;. Also
called the church age, our present age is marked by evil, the dominion of Satan,
darkness, ungodliness, lust, murder, lying and all manner of sin (Ephesians 6:12;
Galatians 1:4). The church is not left out. There is, and there will be a denial of God,
Christ, faith, sound doctrine and Christian living (1 Timothy 4:1-4; 2 Timothy 4:3,4;
3:1-8). The land is under a curse (Genesis 3:17). The devil and all his fallen angels
walk to and fro the whole earth. The atmospheric heavens are polluted by the
activities of Satan. The believers today groan under the harsh and hard conditions
of the earth. They look forward to a change - a new heaven and new earth wherein
dwelleth righteousness and holiness. God has the ultimate plan to judge sinners
who remain obstinate to the call of God to repentance. <b>&ldquo;And whosoever was not
found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</b> Revelation 20:15.
With the final judgement of sinners, God&rsquo;s divine plan is to replace this polluted evil
earth and atmospheric heavens with a new earth and a new heaven that will match
His glory, holiness and righteousness (Revelation 21:1-7). <b>&ldquo;For, behold, I create new
heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come in
to mind &rdquo;</b> (Isaiah 65;17). This gives a good picture of what shall become of the present
earth and heavens. All what we may call beautiful edifices and empires today will
melt away in fervent heat because <b>&ldquo;... the heavens and the earth, which are now,
by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment
and perdition of ungodly men&rdquo;</b> (2 Peter 3:7,10-14). The glories of men and all the
so-called &ldquo;wonders&rdquo; of the world shall not stand this fervent heat. Herein is wisdom:
believers should lay up their treasures in heaven, not on earth <b>&ldquo;where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal&rdquo;</b> (Matthew 6:19).
</p>
<p>
This new creation is entirely free from any taint of sin and therefore the
consequences and effect of sin are absent. Here, there is neither death, sorrow,
pain, tears, nor separation from God (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:4). As God created
the present heavens and earth, so will He create the new heavens and a new earth
- NEW in quality and in TIME. The great, holy and eternal heaven will have new
Jerusalem as its capital. This is the capital of the eternal state called the &ldquo;Bride&rdquo;
because of its virgin beauty, unstained with sin. Here, Christ and all the saints, from
all ages will reside forevermore. Indeed, all things will be new. <b>&ldquo;Behold, I make all
things new&rdquo;</b>. This is the eternal destiny of the saints from all ages. This is the place
Jesus spoke about, <b>&ldquo;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also&rdquo;</b> (John 14:3). It
is certain that all believers with current experience of salvation shall appear with
Him in glory and be like Him (Revelation 21:3; Colossians 3:4).
</p>
<p>
The Holy City, New Jerusalem, is a material city not a mystical one. Its beauty is beyond
human description. About 15,000 miles in length and a breadth and height of about 15,000
miles, the streets are made of pure gold, as clear as glass. With walls of jasper and its twelve
foundations garnished with all manner of precious stones, it has twelve gates of twelve
pearls. The entire city wall is pure gold, as clear as glass. This is a city without any temple.
The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. <b>&ldquo;And the city has no need of the
sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb
is the light thereof&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 21:23). The redeemed of all the earth shall bring their glory
and honour into the city. This is a city whose gates are never shut (Revelation 21:16-26).
The pure river of the water of life, clear as crystal, proceeds out of the throne of God and
the Lamb. The tree of life by the sides of this river bears twelve manner of fruits monthly.
The fruits and leaves are for the healing of the nations. <b>&ldquo;And there shall be no night there;
and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light:
and they shall reign for ever and ever&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 22:5). Words are insufficient to describe
this new creation. But what will it take to partake in this inheritance?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In order to partake in this new inheritance, sinners must repent and believers
must overcome. <b>&ldquo;He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,
and he shall be my son&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 21:7). We must overcome the world (1 John 5:4,5;
2:15-17) and Satan (Revelation 12:11). False prophets, sin and evil must not have
dominion over us. We must flee from all appearances of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22;
Romans 12:17-21). Whether there be persecutions or temptations, we must
overcome to be part of this great inheritance (Revelation 2:10,26-28). The overcomer
is the one that prevails and triumphs over all the works of the devil.
</p>
<p>
The sinner must be thirsty for righteousness and salvation because it will be
costly to miss this glorious experience in the new heavens and the new earth. Christ
promises to... <b>&ldquo;give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of water of life freely&rdquo;</b>
(Revelation 21:6). Sinners must repent today. Backsliders must return to the
Saviour immediately!
</p>
<p>
The life of the redeemed in this eternal city will be glorious. It will be a life of fellowship
(1 Corinthians 13:12), rest (Revelation 14:13), full knowledge (1 Corinthians 13:12),
holiness (Revelation 21:27), joy (Revelation 21:4), service (Revelation 22:3), abundance
(Revelation 21:6), glory (2 Corinthians 4:17) and worship (Revelation 19:1; 7:9-12).
</p>
<p>
<b>&ldquo;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and
whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the
lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death&rdquo;</b> (Revelation
21:8). There is punishment for the unrepentant and coward who would rather chose
to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. They will suffer torment eternally in the lake
of fire. We have only one life to live (Hebrews 9:27), therefore the believer must remain
faithful and steadfast in the Lord, the sinner must repent and be saved and the
backslider must come back home and be restored. Negligence of this &ldquo;so great salvation&rdquo;
will be unfortunate. We should not miss the glories of the New Heaven and the New
Earth. <b>&ldquo;Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy
crown. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he
shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name
of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven
from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. He that hath an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches&rdquo;</b> (Revelation 3:11-13)."

       "Words" => "The fact and reality of Hell is an important and recurring theme in the Scriptures. It is vividly captured as a place of agonizing torment and everlasting punishment in unquenchable fire for the unconverted (Matthew
25:41; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:23,28). Owing to its frightful credentials,
there are those who merely explain away hell as a biblical truth. Many have
even drawn up the broken cisterns of erroneous assertion to rationalise
their gross inadequacies. The Bible, however, unambiguously provides
ample illuminations of hell, as the indisputable abode of sinners
(Psalm 9:17; Proverbs 7:24-27; Proverbs 9:13-18; Mark 9:43-48;
Luke 16:22-28; Revelation 20:13-15; 21:8).
</p>
<p>
Hell is a fearsome &lsquo;restplace&rsquo; for transgressors. And the Lord Jesus Christ spent considerable time lending weight to this reality. He told the city of Capernaum for instance, that it would be turned into hell because of its
iniquities (Matthew 11:23,24).
</p>
<p>
He warned repeatedly on the danger of hell and the need for His listeners
to steer clear of it (Matthew 5:22,29,30; 10:28; 18:8,9; Mark 9:43-48; Luke
12:5). He offered vivid explanations of hell as a place of everlasting
punishment (Matthew 25:41,46; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:22-28; Revelation
14:10,11). He revealed that sinners who die unsaved would have their lot
in hell (Matthew 7:15-19; Matthew 13:40-42,50; 23:33; 25:41-46;
Luke 16:23; Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:14-15; 21:8).
</p>
<p>
The Apostles also followed the same thematic explanations of hell as
offered by the Lord (Romans 2:5-9; 2 Thessalonians 1:8,9; Hebrews 10:26,27;
James 3:5,6; 2 Peter 2:4,9; 3:7; Jude 7, 23; Matthew 3:7-10). The church
today cannot afford to assume a less specific position on the teaching of hell,
without subverting the sacredness and completeness of scripture.
</p>
<p>
The word &lsquo;Hell&rsquo; is found about fifty-four times in the King James Version of the Bible. Its translation in Hebrew, Sheol, occur thirty-one times, while the Greek interpretations &rdquo;Gehena&ldquo;, &rdquo;hades&ldquo; and the latin interpretation &rdquo;Tartarus&ldquo; occur twelve, ten times and once respectively. Its regular usage in scriptures, apart from the allusions drawn to it by the Lord and other Bible characters, lend sufficient validity to its reality.
</p>
<p>
When a sinner dies, his soul immediately proceeds to hell where, with
full consciousness, he tastes the excruciating pain that hell offers. The story
of poor Lazarus and the rich man, best exemplifies the eternal punishment
awaiting the sinner (Luke 16:23,24).
</p>
<p>
Hell is also a place where the memory of the damned comes alive. The
rich man in Luke 16:23,24 remembered his riotous living while on earth as
well as his five brothers yet unsaved. Apart from the acute discomfort of hell,
the regret of an error of judgement while on earth on the part of the unsaved,
presents an everlasting torment of its own.
</p>
<p>
The teaching of the doctrine of hell must scrupulously avoid erroneous
and unscriptural views of false teachers. The concept of purgatory,
representing a so-called intermediate state between death and appearance
before God has no biblical foundation. Neither is the notion of the annihilation
of the wicked correct. The future punishment of the wicked is eternal while
the sinner at death automatically receives an express translation into hell
where <b>&ldquo;their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched&rdquo;</b> (Mark 9:44-48; Deuteronomy 32:22; Job 26:6; Isaiah 5:14; Amos 9:2; 2 Peter 2:4; 2
Thessalonians 1:7-9). The needless controversy over the reality of hell is not
strange as the scriptures clearly allude to this. <b>&ldquo;But the natural man
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness
unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned &rdquo;</b> (I Corinthians 2:14). Since God is holy, sin must be punished in the person of the sinner or in the person of the sinner&rsquo;s substitute, the Lord Jesus Christ.
